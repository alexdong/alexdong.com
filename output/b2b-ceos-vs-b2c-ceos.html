    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>B2C and B2B are two different kinds of businesses and they call for very
different CEOs.</p>
<p>CEOs all need to set the vision, build a team and raise the funding.</p>
<p>But there is something fundamentally different here.</p>
<p>The B2B CEOs sell. Many of them went up the ladder through the sales
track. They are great salespeople and quite often they can be quite
effective task managers that <em>drives</em> the sales pipelines.  Think
Salesforce. Or Linkedin. Both produced awful software products but no
one can argue against their market share or valuations.</p>
<p>The B2C CEOs, however, are product designers by heart. They are very
<em>sensitive</em> to the product and they are obsessed with getting the user
experiences right.  Quite often they have a background in engineering. 
Having worked with a couple over the years, I can testify that they are
every bit awkward and introvert just like a typical engineer. Want some
examples? Ev Williams (Twitter), Steve Chen (my boss, YouTube and
Paypal) or Reed Hastings (Netflix, Pure software) are great examples
here.</p>
<p>Of course, the best CEO excel in both. Like Steve Jobs.</p>
