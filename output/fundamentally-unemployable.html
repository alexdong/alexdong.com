<p>It took him a few years to get going on that, but once he started, there was no turning back.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are a little crazy. That’s a good thing. Some of us can’t do anything else, and can’t take a normal job- and <strong>if we did try to take one, no matter how good of a situation it is, we’d blow it up</strong>. I think having an experience like the one that Noah had at Facebook teaches a lot of different things- not just who we are, but also who we’re not. It’s lucky, in my opinion, that he had such a pivotal experience so early in his career. It means that he’s free, for the rest of his life, to pursue who he really wants to be. Everyone should share that kind of experience</p>
