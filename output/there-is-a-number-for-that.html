      <p>Numbers are clean and precise.  </p>
<p>Life is fuzzy and poetic. </p>
<p>We should develop the muscle to appreciate both. After all, we are born
with a left brain for logic and a right brain for intuition.
Why should we only use one?  </p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief that numbers are cold and cruel. I think
numbers give us a sense of agency. Instead of feeling powerless and at
the mercy of a giant random number generator in the sky, a good model
with a few numbers will help us see the world clearer.  As an
individual, we'll know what to do with our energy and our limited life.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of cool examples. Each takes a thorny question with
substantial social and moral implications and comes up with an experiment to
put a definite number on them. I find the designs fascinating and the
numbers revealing some fascinating aspects of the human psyche. I hope you
enjoy them too. </p>
<p>First. How much is Facebook worth to a user? Answer: $1000 per year.
Quoting from the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global
users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are
hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three
non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to
deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the
populations sampled and the auction design differ across the
experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would
require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While
the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on
the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these
services provide for their users are large.</p>

<p>Second. Whose life worth more? An infant or a pregnant woman? A dog or a
a criminal?  Tough questions, huh?  Well, there is an
answer to that. Infant. And dog. </p>
<p>Even more interesting is that this is also a global preference, which
means that it's the same across 233 countries and cultures. (Here
is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6/figures/2">a direct
link</a> to
the graph. )</p>
<p>Quoting from the
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6">paper</a> on Nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns
about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of
quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that
should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed
the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore
the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered
40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233
countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this
experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we
document individual variations in preferences, based on respondentsâ€™
demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and
uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these
differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits.
We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global,
socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this
article are publicly available.</p>
