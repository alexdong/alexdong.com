      <p>The Verge recently ran a featured story on the risks of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">operating in
Amazon's
Marketplace</a>. </p>
<p>Amazon's Marketplace is an e-commerce platform where 6 million sellers
compete against each other to fulfil your orders. Near two third of the
items sold on Amazon are sold by these third-party sellers. </p>
<p>It turns out that some sellers use Amazon's own rules against each
other, devising intricate schemes to get their rivals suspended.  Once
suspended from the platform, sellers find themselves in a bewildering
appeals system. </p>
<p>To quote the story: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have manipulated product reviews on our site,” an email from
Amazon read. “This is against our policies. As a result, you may no
longer sell on Amazon.com, and your listings have been removed from
our site.”</p>
<p>A rival had framed Plansky for buying five-star reviews, a high crime
in the world of Amazon. The funds in his account were immediately
frozen, and his listings were shut down. Getting his store back would
take him on a surreal weeks-long journey through Amazon’s bureaucracy,
one that began with the click of a button at the bottom of his
suspension message that read “appeal decision.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sad situation to find yourself in as a small business
owner. Plansky certainly had my sympathy. But sadly this is to be expected.</p>
<p>I understand that selling through other people's platform saves tons of
money from marketing, giving a young business a headstart at the
beginning. But building one's entire distribution channel on top of
Amazon is willfully ignoring the basic rule at play here.</p>
<p><strong>The platform wins by making everyone else a replaceable commodity.</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two kinds of businesses: value creation
and arbitrage. </p>
<p>Value creation sets out to make a difference, and the primary
way to win is to create something new that people didn't know they want
it. </p>
<p>Arbitrage is to focus on the things people know they want and identify
the suboptimal market opportunities and buy-low-sell-high. </p>
<p>Value creation makes something new and demands a premium. It wins
through exclusivity. Arbitrage removes any inefficiency in the market
and drives the cost down and makes the products available to a broader
audience.</p>
<p>The platforms win by making all sellers play the arbitrage game. It's a
volume based market. It's a race to the bottom" game. Not a value
creation one. As a business owner, it's our responsibility to know which
game we are playing and deal with our hands well.</p>
