<p>In the context of mass surveillance, however, the RSA key exchange is a serious liability. Your adversaries might not have your private key today, but what they can do now is record all your encrypted traffic. Eventually, they might obtain the key in one way or another (e.g., by bribing someone, obtaining a warrant, or by breaking the key after sufficient technology advances) and, at that time, they will be able to go back in time to decrypt everything.

but generates session keys in such a way that only the two parties involved in the communication can obtain them. No one else can, even if they have access to the server's private key. 
The article provides a good entry-leve description to SSL's support of 
Forward Secrecy using DHE and ECDHE algorithm.  The author also has a follow-up 
post on how to configure Apache, Nginx and OpenSSL to support Forward Secrecy. </p>
