<p>2013 is coming fast. In a few hours, it'll be 1st January, 2013.   A lot have happened in 2012.  It's time to write them down and move on to 2013.</p>
<p>2012 is a watershed year for me.  Before 2012, I was a young man afraid of nothing; I had endless energy and would not even blink on taking on any Goliath standing between myself and the goal; I was a driven and self centred person, I didn't really understand emotion or human relationships.  I considered it a concept opposite to been objective and get things done. I thought it's a waste of time; I genuinely believed that given enough time and focus, I could jump right into any field and did something truly innovative and impressive in a short period of time;  I believed that the world operates on certain rules, only if I could figure them out;  I didn't worry about money. I thought my time and energy were too precious to waste on trivial stuff like that.</p>
<p>2012 has turned me from a young idealistic young man into a pragmatic adult.  I become more self aware, begin to value human relationship.  My interests have finally shifted from pure technical challenges to solving real world problems.</p>
<p>My work experience in 2012 came in two parts.  The first from January to late June.  I am very happy to see clear validation on my technical ability and product design skills.  I am also happily surprised by how good I am on strategic thinking.  I have definitely learned a few things about myself.  I don't have enough patience to work on the tactical tasks; I am ignorant of team rhythm and changed my mind without communicating properly, this has caused me and the people who work for me quite a bit trouble;  I'm not a good listener yet. I have largely ignored developing the soft skills;  I would work really long hours for a while and then either burn myself out or lost interests and have to stop and recharge. I don't operate like a typical engineer. I am more like an artist;  Last but not least, I lack the skill to build up and defend an argument, I am slow and deep thinker. Face-to-face debate is not to my advantage.</p>
<p>The second part, from July to end of November has been challenging and full of drama. It's a painful experience where I act as an individual contributor.  There are some scenes that keep sneaking into my dreams even after a couple of months since I left the job. I was so stressed out that I became really sick twice in four months. I have always been a star employee throughout my career. So I haven't got much chance to observe the team dynamics from ground level.   It's quite rewarding to see how different personalities played out in a highly competitive environment.  I get to understand the leader's most important job is to build a team that can operate on its own, set a clear goal and trust people to deliver it; I start to appreciate the importance of having a goal and stick to it at least for a while even when new information shows up and that goal <em>might</em> not be 100% correct anymore. Team rhythm and morale is too important to be destroyed in a constant change of directions.</p>
<p>I get to see things from a lot more pragmatic viewpoints.  Everyone makes mistakes. Miscommunication exists. Team moves fast and information asymmetries is inevitable. This world is indeed many shades of grey. So instead of trying to work towards an ideal mental model, it's far easier and superior to stay open and keep adjusting the model with new findings.</p>
<p>Working with ex-paypal, ex-youtube, ex-hotmail folks and glean the insights help me to realise that no one can really change the world. We are all surfers manoeuvring for a better position and waiting for the perfect wave to come.  The world is ready to change and there happens to be someone at the right place and right time to make it happen.  There might be 10x or 100x difference in company valuation but at individual level, there really isn't that much difference;  I start to understand the importance of staying in one industry and gradually build up the relationship and the understanding instead of jumping around;</p>
<p>Ordered by priority, here are three things I'd like to focus on in 2013.</p>
<p>First, to have a baby.  Z and I are at the age where the calling is getting really loud. Time for us to send our own messages to the future.</p>
<p>Second, to establish a stable financial foundation. All my previous experiences, either working as an employee or build a business and sell it are all one-shot deal. Once it's done, it's over. I have to keep working on the treadmill and peddling hard.  There are tons of things I would like to do but without a sound financial base, it's always hard for me to do the sales job,  convincing people and constantly managing expectations. I want to have enough money such that I could do things my own way and still be able to leverage capitals out there.  I'd spend time and energy on things that will generate cumulative revenue in the long run, even at the cost of short term financial gains. I would pick one sure-fire product and work on it hard.  On the same time, I want to diversify my energy onto a few other projects to keep myself from burning out and hopefully build a portfolio that can cancel out the inevitable up-and-downs that are out of my own control.</p>
<p>Third, to spend significant time improving myself.  To quote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: <em>You want to know how to paint a perfect painting?  It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.</em>  I'll spend some time on iOS and Object-C in 2013 but I would like to invest the majority of my learning time on soft skills like: to improve my writing skill, both in English and Chinese; to get a lot better at critical thinking, assess information and develop reasoned arguments; to hone my listening skill and be able to communicate my thoughts in a clear and succinct manner. I have long term interests in education and life science and health. I am sitting on the board of two companies in these fields.  I want to to spend more time understanding these two industries and hopefully position myself in the game for a long term success.</p>
<p>2013, we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>To be bluntly honest, my knowledge in economic and financial policy is quite shallow.  I have yet understood how everything is hooked up together and how pulling one string here might trigger some consequences in other places.  I don't have the illusion that I could one day be able to predict what's going to happen. All I want for now is to understand the basic questions.</p>
<p>Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why modern countries no longer uses the golden standard?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is money anyway? Is it a repository or a vehicle to hold value or a pure tool that governments uses to achieve some economic results?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With so many appalling "crimes" Wall Street scientists committed using fiat money, what alternatives out there that offer a more solid ground for an international currency, if it's not USD anymore?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course the core question, shall I suggest my relatives to buy gold instead of USD?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This short book offers some sound answers. I'm sure only time will know which parts are true and which need further adjustments.</p>
<p>The book comes with roughly 3 parts.</p>
<p>The first part is to lay out the reality on where we are in terms of currency and the naive claim that goes back to gold-standard will fix all problems. I personally found this part to be least interesting. I think any avid reader of the Economists magazine will find the contents here rather familiar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is on the credibility of governments that confidence in money has fully depended since 1971, when President Richard Nixon finally broke the link between gold and the dollar. Gold's rise has been the consequence of this crisis of confidence in the paper promises of governments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the advocates of this precious metal distract attention from the debate we need about how to restore the soundness of fiat money.</p>
<p>The second part provides the history of gold, which I enjoyed tremendously.  So it turns out that Silver is probably more widely used as a currency instead of Gold. Also, the gold-standard adopted by Britain was a side-effect from Sir Issac Newton's calculation error.  It also lays out the process where wars forced western countries to keep deviating from gold standard and trade-inbalance ends up severing the link between dollar and gold.</p>
<p>From the evolutionary biology point of view, the separation of currency and gold is a natural step in the long and ongoing evolution process for money.  Money is taking up a dual role as both the container for value as well as a tool for modern governments to affect economic activities. The conflicts between these two roles is where most of the debates come from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is not something absolute. It is a technology that has changed over millennia to meet our evolving need for a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value. That technology has had to adapt to changes in the real world. The rise of democracy drove the abandonment of the gold standard as a monetary system that, though it protected the value of money, was too rigid for modern welfare states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For cash strapped governments through the centuries the answer was obvious: find ways to create more money. The first ruler on record to do this, in or around 400 BC, was Dionysius of Syracuse, who was stuck in a long and expensive war with the powerful trading empire of Carthage in North Africa. His coffers bare, he called in all the 1 drachma coins in circulation, on pain of death, and restamped them as 2 drachma, thereby magically doubling the amount of money in the economy. Such 'debasement' of money — nowadays (allegedly) through quantitative easing rather than restamping coins — is not only of doubtful morality, since governments are in effect robbing from their subjects or citizens, but also tends to have bad consequences. It was a fear of the economic and social upheaval that might be caused by money losing its value that drove Britain to adopt "sound money"</p>
<p>The quick glimpse into the difference between John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek is fascinating as well. This is the first time that I finally understand where Keynes come from and get to appreciate his perspective. I'd certainly try to read more about these two person and their books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keynes, a gregarious and mercurial British intellectual, dazzled his peers with his brilliance and offered hope that even the seemingly most intractable economic problems could be solved by reasoning and, in certain circumstances, government action. Hayek, born in Vienna, was more pessimistic, warning of the excesses of big government and the inherent difficulty of top down economic policymaking. As he wrote in his last book, The Fatal Conceit, the "curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keynes looked at money in a different way to his predecessors in economic thinking. Rather than judging money simply in terms of how well it measures and stores value, Keynes took a broader, utilitarian view, asking how money influenced the behaviour of the economy as a whole. Money, he believed, should be judged not on whether it was sound or not but on whether it served the needs of the economy. If sound money was causing unemployment, as it was in the 1920s and 1930s, do not blame the unemployed, blame money.</p>
<p>One of the implications of this reimagining of money was that, rather than celebrating its role as a store of value over time, Keynes focused on how demand for it varied with the public's appetite for risk.</p>
<p>Instead of government-supplied fiat money, he (Hayek) argued, there should be privately-created money. Guided by self-interest rather than politics, this would be free from the distortions of government money. Money, he believed, should be as freely traded as any other product or service. Thanks to the wisdom of the invisible hand of the market, which always exceeds the skill of the bureaucrat, money would become smarter, more efficient and more reliable. Governments might still choose to issue currencies, but these would only remain in circulation, he predicted, if citizens found them to be reliable stores of value. Market discipline would drive out unreliable money and promote sound money. (This looks a bit like how America ran its money before the Legal Tender Act of 1862 made the dollar a government monopoly.)</p>
<p>The third part is, in my own words, cases for buying gold.  The book lists 3 potential scenarios where most of them would be a good case, but not an absolute one, for diversifying investments by buying in gold, which I found a quite natural and not very surprising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This case for gold is, we believe, very different from the one offered by gold fundamentalists. The current resurgence of gold may be understood best not as a return to "true money", nor, indeed, the beginning of the revival of a barbarous relic, but as part of the latest phase of innovation in the technology of money. It will not be the last.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the government deficit swells, and the political costs involved in cutting it by either spending less or taxing more grow ever larger, the temptation for politicians to reach for the inflation button may prove irresistible. The details of exactly how it would be done would no doubt remain murky: a technical rule change here by the Fed or the Treasury, a dismissal of a high inflation number as a one off there. Just as it has asserted its commitment to a strong dollar while pursuing policies that seem designed to weaken it, the US government would no doubt proclaim that it is determined to win the 'War on Higher Prices' even as it opens the monetary spigot ever wider.</p>
<p>The resurgence of gold needs to be taken seriously by us all, because of what it tells us about the economic challenges now facing our world and the effectiveness (or lack of it) of our efforts to tackle them.</p>
<p>Money is a matter of faith. Bits of paper and computer bytes change hands billions of times a day as a measure of value because we trust the promise that they represent. In today's era of fiat money, those promises rest ultimately on a guarantee by governments that they are valuable.
If you are looking for signals to buy gold as a hedge against a government-driven policy of inflation, one would be a lack of serious debate about deficit reduction during the 2012 presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>The book also covers a little bit on alternative currencies and bitcoin but I found its effort rather shallow and lack of anything that's truly new or inspirational.  It also talks about a syndicate of multiple currencies into an international currency, an idea from Hayek, but it faces so many challenges that I wouldn't even think it's possible.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a role model.  Mine is Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor clothing company Patagonia.   He is the type of entrepreneur who insists that he wants to<strong> do things on my own terms</strong>.  As a successful business man, he starts the book by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been a businessman for almost fifty years. It's as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or a lawyer.  I've never respected the profession. It's business that has to take the majority of the blame for being the enemy of nature, for destroying native cultures, for taking from the poor and giving to the rich, and for poisoning the earth with the effluent from its factories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet business can produce food, cure disease, control population, employ people, and generally enrich our lives. And it can do these good things and make a profit without losing its soul. That's what this book is about.</p>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> that attitude.</p>
<p>The book starts by going through the history of Patagonia, its early "by climber, for climber" root. It's great detail to product's quality. It's "simplify" philosophy. Then it goes on to explain the crisis of Patagonia, the credit crisis and the soul searching part.</p>
<p>Then it dives into the 8 philosophies of Patagonia. As a software entrepreneur, I found his "Product Design", "Production", "Image", "Human Resource" and "Management" are of particular interest to me. ( Yes, the environmental philosophy is so well known that, as a nature lover, I consider it to be common sense. Although I believe it's not a case for most people. ) As usual, here are some great quotes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Make the best product" is the raison d'etre of Patagonia and the cornerstone of our business philosophy.  Striving to make the best quality product is the reason we got into business in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify, simplify. - H.D. Thoreau
One "simplify" would have sufficed. - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>Weight quality first, against on-time delivery and low cost. A more sales-driven company might sacrifice a degree of quality to achieve on-time delivery, and a mass marketer might sacrifice both quality and on-time delivery to maintain the lowest cost.  Patagonia puts quality first, period.
Of course, if you do choose quality <em>against</em> on-time delivery or <em>against</em> paying a reasonable price, don't pat yourself on the back.  You've already blown it. You have to strive constantly to achieve all three, but quality is "more equal".</p>
<p>A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation.  He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both. - Francois Auguste Rene Chateaubriand</p>
<p>We don't hire the kind of people you can order around, like the foot soldiers in an army who charge from their foxholes without question when their sergeant yells, "Let's go, boys!" We want the kind of employee who will question the wisdom of something he regards as a bad  decision. We do want people who, once they buy into a decision and believe in what they are doing, will work like demons to produce something of the highest possible quality.</p>

<p>We are certainly living in an interesting time.  Besides all the financial crisis looming on the horizon, there are some fundamental challenges facing all the countries, that is <strong>unemployment because of technology advancement</strong>. In Spain, 60% people under 35 are unemployed. Despite all the seemingly good new, US is still losing job positions. But this time, it's not because of outsourcing to China or India, but because more and more jobs have been replaced by robots.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="201"]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI"><img alt="" src="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cover-201x300.jpg"></a> Race Against The Machine $3.99[/caption]</p>
<p>This book is written by two professors from <a href="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/authors/">MIT Centre for Digital Business</a>. This thin book really discussed two things: most jobs today will be replaced by robots and how we can cope with that.</p>
<p>First, many of the mid-range jobs done by human being will be replaced by robots. This is the same thing that has happened to the horses in 19th century and bank tellers before ATM was introduced.  This has become very obvious when the recent economic recovery in US has seen strong growth yet no job has been created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grim unemployment statistics puzzled many because other measures of business health rebounded pretty quickly after the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009. GDP growth averaged 2.6% in the seven quarters after the recession’s end, a rate 75% as high as the long-term average over 1948-2007. U.S. corporate profits reached new records. And by 2010, investment in equipment and software returned to 95% of its historical peak, the fastest recovery of equipment investment in a generation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most economists aren't taking these worries very seriously. The idea that computers might significantly disrupt human labor markets—and, thus, further weaken the global economy—so far remains on the fringes.</p>
<p>College graduates who seek the traditional type of job, where someone else tells them what to do each day, will find themselves increasingly in competition with machines, which excel at following detailed instructions</p>
<p>The root of our problems is not that we’re in a Great Recession, or a Great Stagnation, but rather that we are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, the stagnation of median incomes primarily reflects a fundamental change in how the economy apportions income and wealth. The median worker is losing the race against the machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, the authors suggest that the only way we human being can win this battle "against" the machine is to work side-by-side with the machine. As a society,  it's time for another good shake to some fundamental things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best chess player is a team of humans using computers.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the computer, like all general purpose technologies, requires parallel innovation in business models, organizational processes structures, institutions, and skills. These intangible assets, comprising both organizational and human capital, are often ignored on companies’ balance sheets and in the official GDP statistics, but they are no less essential than hardware and software.</p>
<p>The most productive firms reinvented and reorganized decision rights, incentives systems, information flows, hiring systems, and other aspects of organizational capital to get the most from the technology. This, in turn, required radically different and, generally, higher skill levels in the workforce</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Education</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also enables unbundling of instruction, evaluation, and certification, which encourages educational systems to be based more on delivering genuine, measurable results and less on simply signaling selection, effort, and prestige.</p>
<p>Combining videoconferencing, software, and networks with local teachers and tutors has a number of potential advantages. The very best “superstar” teachers can be “replicated” via technology, giving more students a chance to learn from them.In particular, softer skills like leadership, team building, and creativity will be increasingly important.</p>

<p>Luckily he has an answer and it’s a good one: <strong>“Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it”. </strong></p>
<p>This then is Principle Two for the successful optimist. All successful optimists have a project that is bigger than they are. By contrast, people who have a project that is the same size as themselves are invariably miserable and tedious company. Once you’ve got a bigger car/ nicer house/ television bigger than God what’s left? As so many find out, eventually the answer is a nagging emptiness accompanied by the thought, “Surely there must be more to life than this?”</p>
<p>Those with something bigger than themselves generally derive a deep-in-the-core happiness from whatever that is.<strong> It’s a happiness that comes from a feeling you have a place in the world.</strong> A ‘bigger than me’ project can be your family, your religion, military service or a scientific calling. You don’t have to agree with another person’s ‘bigger than me’ project but it is true that people who have them are usually more driven, positive and able to get things done as a result. This is a happiness different from the passing pleasures of a good night out or great joke, and it will not manifest itself as merriment, but its motivating power is fundamental to the successful optimist.</p>

<p>They danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I've been doing all my life after<strong> people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!"</strong></p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Today is my last day at Avos.</p>
<p>I'm feeling very grateful about this experience. I have learned so much in the past 14 months that I can't believe it's only a little more than 1 year.  This is my first "job" working out of mainland China, in a pure western culture. Also my first job working in the consumer internet space.   I'm sure that as the time goes by, the memory will become fuzzier.  So while the scenes are still fresh, I'd like to list what I have learned from all the outstanding people in Avos.  As my own way to say thank you and wave good bye to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Josh:  Remain calm and cool when some unexpected problem happens. Josh showed me what a truly talented engineer would be.  It's less about how much you know but how you can get the problem solved using the tools on hand.  I have always considered myself a good engineer but Josh made me realise that I'm too emotional to keep my brain always cool and logic.  Josh makes me feel I'm more an artist than an engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alan: Been professional means high performance no matter how you are treated.  I cherish the night when Alan, Israel and me walked back from office to hotel when we were in San Francisco. I've been consistently stunned by how hard and consistent Alan works no matter how much mis-understanding there have been.  He never seems to care whose fault it is. He just gets there and tries to get things sorted.  He also taught me again and again that "form follows function".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gerwin: A team needs colour. Also what a young talent can learn and do in such a short period of time.  I love to tease Gerwin at work. I actually like to hear him cursing. It reminds me of my college years where I cursed like a sailor.  I think Gerwin brings colour and a bit spicy to an otherwise boring and too serious engineering team. Making us a better team really.   Besides that, his young age and how much he knows about javascript/css is clearly telling me that the web-native generation has grown up. Gerwin, you always makes me feel old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ben:  Reliable, quiet and he-speaks-and-people-listen. I totally under-estimated Ben at the beginning.  You see, we value what we know.  Ben is this quiet, shy guy who seldom speaks. But as we collaborate side-by-side for the last a few months, I get to appreciate how he works. He is almost totally opposite from who I am. Hence making him a perfect work to work with.  Every morning, if I open up the mail and notice the bug reports, I would close it right away. I get bored checking system status dashboard everyday.  Yet Ben would happily pour his morning coffee and quietly squashed all the bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BH:  Myself 12 years ago. I like BH because I always looked at him and thought to myself: wow, I did the exact same thing 12 years ago.  We always value talents, passion and energy. We under-value consistency, professional and maturity. But as I work with BH through the up and down, sitting in downtown San Francisco's hotel and listen to his rants, I found myself just loving him for all the youth idealism and energy. So pure and untainted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Israel: The importance of knowing one's strength/weakness well. Israel have had a rough trip. He was assigned to the roles that were needed but didn't suit him.  Israel also keeps on reminding me how much a job means to a family.  For every job position, there is actually a whole family's happiness associated with it. There is his beautiful wife waiting at home. There are his two young boys asking where Dad is. I will not handle job positions lightly just because of this. People are not switchable widgets. They have emotions and families.  They deserve to be treated with respect and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steve: How leader works. I do not agree with Steve on all things but I'd say most of the times, I am quietly impressed by how laser focused he is on the product.  I learned the value of being firm about an idea and push through to get a vision implemented instead of trying to convince everyone.  I am also on the receiver end to know how productive and happy I was when I had the trust and freedom to operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tim: Every engineering team needs a Tim. I've been working with Tim back in the old trunk.ly days but the past 14 months has shown the immense value of having a "tim" on the team.  To tight the loose ends and keep the whole team rowing towards the same direction.  I learn again and again from Tim the value of perform consistently no matter one gets the attention or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also others I have had the luck to work with that's not mentioned here, especially Andy, Lucy, Cheng, Vijay, Walter, Brent, Doug, Matt, George and Sara. I've also learned heaps from you folks.  Thanks.</p>
