<p>TL;DR:  Of all the news coverage on Aaron Swartz's case, <strong>Guardian</strong> provided the best coverage; <strong>Economist</strong> got and described the core accurately and timely;  <strong>NYTimes</strong> got the key points, but failed to follow up; <strong>BBC</strong> structured it as a "debate"; Japan's <strong>Yomiuri</strong> and <strong>Asahi</strong>, China's <strong>PeopleDaily</strong> had no coverage of this; <strong>WSJ</strong> is misleading its readers by associating the cause with depression; China's <strong>Xinhua</strong> performed the worst by talking about "<em>prevalence of depression in the tech community"</em>.</p>
<p>Aaron Swartz's funeral has come and past.  It's time for us to move on. But before we dive into all the new year's works, it is very important for us to review what the major newspapers around the world have said about this and use it as a gauge to see where they position themselves on this case.  Or to put it more bluntly: did they get it? <strong>Did they get the core of this case is "free access to public document" instead of IP theft, national security or suicide after long depression? </strong></p>
<p>This is important because this case won't be the last collision between technologists who try to push the world forward and the incumbents who don't understand technology's role and want to set a precedent to stop this inevitable trend.   As software and AI evolve further, more labour and manual jobs will be replaced by robots and algorithms. Whether we will have a relatively smooth transition or a turmoil largely depends on how the public opinions are shaped. So far, it doesn't look very good. As said by <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/01/aaron_swartz_suicide_prosecutors_have_too_much_power_to_charge_and_intimidate.html">slate</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The underlying point ... is that the government doesn’t understand hackers and isn’t good at distinguishing between miscreant vigilantes like Swartz who are trying to free information systems and profit-driven or diabolical hackers who are trying to bring down those systems. That’s when an expansive law like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act becomes dangerous. Prosecutors persuaded of their own righteousness, and woodenly equating downloading a deliberately unprotected database with stealing, lose all sense of proportion and bring in the heavy artillery when what’s in order is a far more mild penalty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, let's get started.</p>
<p><strong>Guardian</strong> offers the <strong>best writing</strong> on this.  Article <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/ortiz-heymann-swartz-accountability-abuse">Carmen Ortiz and Stephen Heymann: accountability for prosecutorial abuse</a> directly points the root of the problem</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the US government - as part of its war to vest control over the internet in itself and in corporate factions - has been wildly excessive, almost hysterical, in punishing even trivial and harmless activists who are perceived as "hackers".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jan/15/aaron-swartz-husband-prosecutor-criticises">Aaron Swartz: husband of prosecutor criticises internet activist's family</a>, author provides lots of in-depth interview with Aaron's lawyers and attorneys to shed lights into the gruelling negotiation process that Aaron has gone through; and the ugly, disgusting faces of the prosecutors.   Now compare this to WSJ's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/AP2e1b837317d14dbab268f56bff084b10.html">brief coverage</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andy Good, Swartz's initial lawyer, told the Boston Globe that he had warned one prosecutor, Steve Heymann, that his client was a "suicide risk".
Good said: "His reaction was a standard reaction in that office, not unique to Steve. He said: 'Fine, we'll lock him up.'  I'm not saying they made Aaron kill himself. Aaron might have done this anyway. I'm saying they were aware of the risk, and they were heedless."
Lawyers for Swartz said they had offered to accept a deferred prosecution or probation, so that if he did it again he would serve time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marty Weinberg, who took over from Good as Swartz's lawyer, confirmed to the Guardian that during negotiations for a plea bargain, MIT refused to take a position which could have helped his client.
Weinberg said: "During pleas negotiations for Mr Swartz, he attempted to negotiate an agreement that would not subject him to any risk of going to prison. We asked them to support this initiative but they declined. As a matter of fact, MIT as an institution communicated to myself that they would not take any position in ongoing pleas negotiations between Mr Swartz and the government."
"There were subsets of the MIT community who were profoundly in support of Aaron," but that support did not override institutional interests, Weinberg told the Globe.</p>
<p>Another of Swartz's attorneys, Elliot Peters, said on Monday that MIT officials were "very cooperative with prosecutors" during the investigation.</p>
<p>Economist, my favourite magazine, pointed out the essence of this case in its article <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/01/remembering-aaron-swartz?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/commons_man">Commons Man</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO CALL Aaron Swartz gifted would be to miss the point. As far as the internet was concerned, he was the gift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around 2006 he obtained—though he would not say how—the complete bibliographic data for books held by the Library of Congress. He thought it unfair that the Library's catalogue division charged hefty fees to provide this information, which, <strong>being the work of the government, had no copyright protection within the United States.</strong> So he posted it in the Open Library, which aims to provide an entry for every book in existence as part of Internet Archive, a project founded by the internet entrepreneur Brewster Kahle to store a copy of every web page of every website ever to go online.</p>
<p>Aghast at how federal court documents were available only for a price from the inappositely named Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system, in 2009 he used the free access temporarily granted to public libraries to retrieve 18m pages of PACER's 500m documents before he was cut off. They ended up on public.resource.org, founded by Carl Malamud, a veteran advocate of open access, also known as the internet's public librarian.</p>
<p>While Economists correctly pointed out Swartz's cause was open access to public documents, the <strong>NYTimes</strong> was mostly writing about him as a purist all-information-must-be-free ideologue.  But to its credit, it did mention the cause of changing the <em>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</em> in article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/technology/aaron-swartz-a-data-crusader-and-now-a-cause.html?pagewanted=all&amp;pagewanted=print">A Data Crusader, a Defendant and Now, a Cause</a> and provide a link to the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/reform-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-reflect-realities-computing-and-networks-2013/qMvdwVNw">petition</a> itself. The article <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/what-is-a-hacktivist/">What Is a ‘Hacktivist’?</a> comes at the right time to paint a personal, friendly and make-the-world-better picture of hacktivist.  But somehow they stopped from following through the case. They didn't challenge Carmen Ortiz's husband's tweet either.</p>
<p>Sadly, majority of the traditional newspapers either failed to appreciate the importance of this event or, even worse, try to distract attentions by associating this with depression.</p>
<p><strong>BBC</strong> barely scratched the issue during this event.  It did mention this case in article <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21011663">Aaron Swartz investigation ordered by MIT</a>. It seems to me that BBC has failed to grasp the essence of this event by finishing the article with this:<strong>
</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, in a blog post, Orin Kerr, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School, wrote the actions of the prosecutors had been "based on a fair reading of the law".
"None of the charges involved aggressive readings of the law or any apparent prosecutorial overreach," he said.
"All of the charges were based on established case law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan's two most popular newspaper <strong>Yomiuri</strong>, <strong>Asahi</strong> and China's government mouthpiece <strong>PeopleDaily</strong> has no mentions at all.</p>
<p><strong>WSJ</strong> is muddying the water by linking this to the suicide and depression angle even though more than <a href="Even though more than 80% of its reader rate the charge was &quot;overzealous&quot;: http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/question-day-229/topics/do-you-think-governments-prosecution">80% of its readers vote the charge to be "overzealous"</a></p>
<p>Its article <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324595704578242230974876860.html">Web Activist's Suicide Highlights Tech Law</a> began with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mental-health experts cautioned against trying to settle on an explicit cause when someone kills himself. "I'm sure he perceived that as a stressor," Gregory Eells, director of counseling and psychological services at Cornell University, said of the criminal charges. But, he said, "It's always a stretch to say that's the only cause." Mr. Eells wasn't familiar with details of the Swartz case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and ended with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On what would prove to be the morning of his death, Ms. Stinebrickner-Kauffman said, the couple had a tickle fight before she left for work. Mr. Swartz said he was going to stay home and rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its other article <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324581504578238692048200404.html">Legal Case Strained Troubled Web Activist</a> went even further by talking about "state sponsored hackers who threaten national security" and "organized criminals who break into computers for financial gain".  WSJ, you were really trying hard to establish some link in your reader's mind, aren't you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What began as a straightforward report of a campus breaking-and-entering incident eventually ensnared Mr. Swartz, who had written publicly about his battle with depression, in the broader federal apparatus for prosecuting computer crimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the top of their list of targets are state-sponsored hackers who threaten national security and organized criminals who break into computers for financial gain. The longest prison sentence so far in a U.S. hacking case—20 years–was given to a Miami man, Albert Gonzalez, in 2010 for his role in the theft and sale of millions of credit and debit cards.
In recent years, prosecutors in the U.S. and Europe have become increasingly concerned about the growth of hacking groups, known as "hacktivists."
The groups, sometimes formed under the guise of free-lance computer-security firms, have exposed the security vulnerabilities of computers used by government, law enforcement and corporations through online mischief.</p>
<p>But nothing comes as classic as China's <strong>XinHua's</strong> blatant distraction tactic in its article <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-01/15/c_132103916.htm">Suicide of U.S. Internet activist fuels talk about depression</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prominent U.S. Internet developer and activist Aaron Swartz committed suicide last week, which triggered heated discussion in Startupland these days about the prevalence of depression in the tech community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow me to finish this article by quoting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/13/aaron-swartz-government-abuses-gilmor">Dan Gillmor's post</a> on Guardian</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember Aaron Swartz by working against government abuses</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I lived in Massachusetts, where the U.S. Attorney with overall jurisdiction over Aaron's case may run for governor, I'd start working tomorrow to ensure that she couldn't get elected dogcatcher. I'd also raise money to pay the best and bravest lawyer I could find, to ask the Massachusetts Bar Association to investigate how she and the assistant U.S. attorney in direct charge of the case had acted, and whether they deserved to keep their licenses to practice law.</p>
<p>No matter where I lived, I would ask my member of the US House and my US senators how they can allow the computer crime laws they passed to criminalize a violation of a terms of service – an interpretation that could put any one of us in jail under the Justice Department's misuse of the law. If the people representing me didn't respond or expressed support for the administration's you're-all-potential-prisoners stance, I'd look for better representatives.</p>
<p>If I wrote software code for, say, Facebook or any other big company, or was a young coder considering a startup, I'd ask myself whether my work was worthy of Aaron's memory – and if not, what I would do about that.
And I'd find and support organizations, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, that are carrying on the work Aaron championed, and did, to bring our culture and laws into the 21st Century in ways that value creativity, openness and collaboration.</p>
<p>Get angry. Then get busy.</p>

<p>So it is true.  Aaron has killed himself.  That sucks.  I tried very hard not to cry but it hurts me deeply.</p>
<p>I never had a chance to meet him in person but over the years, I get to "meet" him via his work.  I've always been surprised that such a prodigy actually exists among us. I've also had this weird feeling that he won't die of age.</p>
<p>Aaron's code is a beautiful example of minimalism. Around 2006, I remember trying really hard to beat his abstraction of a python wrapper for db operations in <a href="https://github.com/webpy/webpy/blob/master/web/db.py">web/db.py</a>. I gave up after two weeks of attempts and reached a conclusion that he has achieved a perfect balance of just enough function. The whole thing is short, logic and beautiful. Like a poem. You can't take anything away from it.  He was 18 years old by then.</p>
<p>Aaron's work is like that too.  Reddit was a good example of that where you can get raw thoughts and insightful discussions without worrying too much of format and etiquette. His less known work of Jottit is actually more impressive.  It's a failed attempt to build a minimal website where one can  publish raw ideas quick and easy. I had wanted to build a site like that but Aaron built exactly what I had in mind with a crispy clarity of purpose.  I named this blog "Raw thoughts from Alex Dong" after him as well.  A place to exchange ideas without all the fluffy, airy, wishy-washing bullshit.</p>
<p>A friend who used to work in a suicide help centre told me that, to many people, suicide is a way of revenge. It's one's last attempt to bet everything on this final attack.  I guess what Aaron is attacking is not only the legal case itself. But the cruel reality of this world.  Where an idealistic will eventually bump into layers and layers of lies; the ignorance of the general public; cold face from people who have already taken the pill and given up.  The more prodigious you are, the harder you get hit on the head.  Everyone has been saying how great you are and what a promising career you have in front of you. Then bump! Out of blue, you realise you are alone. Fighting hopeless without seeing the light.   Aaron has been so young yet so successful that when the harsh of the reality raised its ugly head right in front of him, he chose to keep attacking and attacking. Wish that he could win. He bet his most precious asset, his life, on this final attack.   But he has lost. He failed to find out the right tactic.  I worry that his death is futile. I worry that the world will soon move on with all the weekend entertainment, I worry that his cause will be forgotten.</p>
<p>We programmers, with our new found power, are more likely to be idealistic about things. If something doesn't make sense, sure it should and can be fixed. The only problem is how long the code-debug cycle runs.  We believe that if only we can express our thoughts clearer, we could make a case and win. Then we would be busy moving to the next thing.   Yet the world moves painfully slowly. Most status quo disappears when they die of age.  This is a reality that's just not compatible with programmer's view.</p>
<p>I have wished that Aaron would be like Steve Jobs.  Learn the ways to make compromises. Put his head down and work on something that's hard. Then eventually change the world for the better.  Move humanity one step forward.   Before Steve Jobs, not many people in valley gives a shit about design, aesthetics. It's about tech, someone has told me.  After Steve Jobs, everyone suddenly starts to talk about "beautiful".</p>
<p>To me, Aaron's death is a reminder to the rest of us idealistic programmers.  It told us loud and clear that we have to pick a battle that worth fighting for and be prepared for the hard, long, lonely journey. And hopefully come out from the other end knowing that we've tried our best and we have not wasted our talent and live.  We can finally rest in peace.</p>
<p>Bye, Aaron.</p>

<p>I wasn't a top student in schools. My parents got called into school to "figure out a solution" a lot often than others.  I excel in some classes like history, chemistry and math but not others like literature.  I was appalling bad at remembering all those beautiful Chinese poems no matter how many times I tried to remember them.  I have never really understood why until I took the "<a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">learning style</a>" test.</p>
<p>During the test, you will get to answer 40 a/b questions and in the end, you'll be presented with a report like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Results for: Alex Dong</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ACT                  X                                REF

<ul>
<li>If your score on a scale is 1-3, you are fairly well balanced on the two dimensions of that scale.</li>
<li>If your score on a scale is 5-7, you have a moderate preference for one dimension of the scale and will learn more easily in a teaching environment which favors that dimension.</li>
<li>If your score on a scale is 9-11, you have a very strong preference for one dimension of the scale. You may have real difficulty learning in an environment which does not support that preference.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So a few interesting things I learned about myself.  <em>It's very scary to realise about this at age 35.</em>  If I have known this test early in my life, I am sure I would make a lot of choices quite differently. (Explanation can be found <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.htm">here</a>. )</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm a bit extreme on VISual vs VeRBal factor. This is exactly why I am so slow processing words, debating and remembering but I can clearly remember all the details of a street corner I drove past in a foreign city 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm a strong GLObal instead of SEQuence learner, which means I will not carefully follow through a sequence of steps and my thoughts jump around quite a bit.  This explains one long question in my mind.  No matter how hard I try, it's almost impossible for me to get a high score in exams. I often forget to read the questions fully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer to play with something to understand it, that makes me a ACTive instead of a REFlective learner.  I guess this is the reason why I prefer computer programming instead of mechanical engineering because fundamentally I need to play to understand whereas most mechanical stuffs are done in CAD software and simulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm also a INTuitive instead of SENsing learner where I hate to repeat and love to play with new things.  So trying to force myself to become a diligence worker who consistently delivers just works against my nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the future of education, I believe all kids will be "profiled" so that a personalised course set will be delivered that tailored to the student's learning style.</strong>  I can smell some opportunities around the corner here.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Hacker News has long become too watery for my liking but I do routinely check out the "<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments">bestcomment</a>" page, which always surprises me with delight and insightful comments.</p>
<p>Like this <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4989923">one</a> on trivial applications and the stagnation of real progress in tech world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people in charge have no vision. Everyone makes this complaint, because it's almost always true. The difference is that it's starting to matter. You can't "do technology" without vision. Not anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're running a toothpaste factory, you don't need vision. You just need competent execution. You need people to show up and follow the plan without complaint. This kind of work can actually be managed. If you can cut costs without compromising on quality, you do it. It's not about vision. That's already solved. Vision was relevant long ago when someone figured out how to make toothpaste. Your job is just to keep abreast of competitors and seek rent.</p>
<p><strong>VC-istan is a postmodern startup factory.</strong> It's technically not a company, but as a tight social network, it functions as one. VCs, rather than properly competing, talk to each other and agree on who they like and who they don't. VC-istan's "serial entrepreneurs" are just glorified PMs whose egos make them unemployable. <strong>The real bosses are the VCs.</strong> They want quick exits, as they should, because that's how the incentive systems that govern them are set up. <strong>The "tech press" are a sort of HR organization. Entrepreneurs are PMs, often mediocre ones, and engineers are chumps paid in lottery tickets.</strong> This is just a big company that has managed to dress itself up as a thousand small ones that happen to be all controlled by the same people.</p>
<p>Now you have an ecosystem of commodity entrepreneurs hiring commodity engineers to implement commodity ideas. Ok, nothing to see here. Mobiles skwrking, mobiles chirping, take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money...</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that this isn't producing innovation? It shouldn't be. Yet VC-istan is doing a lot better than most large companies do. It seems inevitable in large organizations (including economies) that the resources gravitate toward players who don't have much in the way of vision. Innovation is the <em>exception</em>. It adds variance. Given that we're social animals who judge one another based on reliability (low variance/minimal performance) rather than capability (expected return) it is socially <em>dangerous</em>.</p>
<p>How many people have the talent and the resources? I'm sitting on +4 sigma talent but have no money. The people with boatloads of money seem (with a few exceptions) to be lacking in vision (which means I can't tell if they have talent, but I have doubts). I can't say that I blame them. Why take risks if you have no need to do so?</p>
<p>What we have now is a generation that's used to technical progress and wants to take part. We have people who have been working their asses off since age 4, are now in their 20s and 30s, and want to take part in technical innovation. Most of them can't, because there's so little of it actually going on, and because most work activity is bullshit oriented toward keeping one warlord boss's status high at the expense of another's, rather than being invested in true progress. That's depressing. It creates a malaise. A deep sense of ennui. Yawn, another fart app. We now have an unprecedented number of ridiculously talented, over-educated people saying, "Dude, where's my machine learning job?"</p>
<p><strong>I think that 2013 will see the beginning of a Flight to Substance, and if I'm right, that will put that talent to better use than fart apps and toilet check-in services. I don't know how it will play out. I have no clue who will fund it.</strong> One sign of this is the increasing clamor for Valve-style open allocation. By the mid-2010s, you won't be considered a real tech company if you're running closed allocation (take heed, Google). If I'm right, that will help. That will help our generation work its way toward excellence. At least, some of us will go in that direction. Others will go off into the weeds of fart apps. May the market reward both crowds justly.</p>
<p>Here's how we fix tech.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open allocation. As long as the work is relevant to the company's needs, let people work on whatever they want. This enables <em>native</em> growth of technical talent. You don't have to poach qualified people with ridiculous signing bonuses. They quickly find a project that fits their skills and interests, and they actually improve while they work for you. Imagine that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop fetishizing either extreme of company size. Not all large companies are bad, not all startups are good. Nor vice versa. If your 50-person startup is running closed allocation with typical HR policies, then it's just a big company that failed to get big and it should be considered a massive joke. I've heard of people getting turned down for transfers in 20-person companies because of "headcount" limitations. If you want to work at a startup, then drop that shit and work for a real fucking startup.</p>

<p>2013 is coming fast. In a few hours, it'll be 1st January, 2013.   A lot have happened in 2012.  It's time to write them down and move on to 2013.</p>
<p>2012 is a watershed year for me.  Before 2012, I was a young man afraid of nothing; I had endless energy and would not even blink on taking on any Goliath standing between myself and the goal; I was a driven and self centred person, I didn't really understand emotion or human relationships.  I considered it a concept opposite to been objective and get things done. I thought it's a waste of time; I genuinely believed that given enough time and focus, I could jump right into any field and did something truly innovative and impressive in a short period of time;  I believed that the world operates on certain rules, only if I could figure them out;  I didn't worry about money. I thought my time and energy were too precious to waste on trivial stuff like that.</p>
<p>2012 has turned me from a young idealistic young man into a pragmatic adult.  I become more self aware, begin to value human relationship.  My interests have finally shifted from pure technical challenges to solving real world problems.</p>
<p>My work experience in 2012 came in two parts.  The first from January to late June.  I am very happy to see clear validation on my technical ability and product design skills.  I am also happily surprised by how good I am on strategic thinking.  I have definitely learned a few things about myself.  I don't have enough patience to work on the tactical tasks; I am ignorant of team rhythm and changed my mind without communicating properly, this has caused me and the people who work for me quite a bit trouble;  I'm not a good listener yet. I have largely ignored developing the soft skills;  I would work really long hours for a while and then either burn myself out or lost interests and have to stop and recharge. I don't operate like a typical engineer. I am more like an artist;  Last but not least, I lack the skill to build up and defend an argument, I am slow and deep thinker. Face-to-face debate is not to my advantage.</p>
<p>The second part, from July to end of November has been challenging and full of drama. It's a painful experience where I act as an individual contributor.  There are some scenes that keep sneaking into my dreams even after a couple of months since I left the job. I was so stressed out that I became really sick twice in four months. I have always been a star employee throughout my career. So I haven't got much chance to observe the team dynamics from ground level.   It's quite rewarding to see how different personalities played out in a highly competitive environment.  I get to understand the leader's most important job is to build a team that can operate on its own, set a clear goal and trust people to deliver it; I start to appreciate the importance of having a goal and stick to it at least for a while even when new information shows up and that goal <em>might</em> not be 100% correct anymore. Team rhythm and morale is too important to be destroyed in a constant change of directions.</p>
<p>I get to see things from a lot more pragmatic viewpoints.  Everyone makes mistakes. Miscommunication exists. Team moves fast and information asymmetries is inevitable. This world is indeed many shades of grey. So instead of trying to work towards an ideal mental model, it's far easier and superior to stay open and keep adjusting the model with new findings.</p>
<p>Working with ex-paypal, ex-youtube, ex-hotmail folks and glean the insights help me to realise that no one can really change the world. We are all surfers manoeuvring for a better position and waiting for the perfect wave to come.  The world is ready to change and there happens to be someone at the right place and right time to make it happen.  There might be 10x or 100x difference in company valuation but at individual level, there really isn't that much difference;  I start to understand the importance of staying in one industry and gradually build up the relationship and the understanding instead of jumping around;</p>
<p>Ordered by priority, here are three things I'd like to focus on in 2013.</p>
<p>First, to have a baby.  Z and I are at the age where the calling is getting really loud. Time for us to send our own messages to the future.</p>
<p>Second, to establish a stable financial foundation. All my previous experiences, either working as an employee or build a business and sell it are all one-shot deal. Once it's done, it's over. I have to keep working on the treadmill and peddling hard.  There are tons of things I would like to do but without a sound financial base, it's always hard for me to do the sales job,  convincing people and constantly managing expectations. I want to have enough money such that I could do things my own way and still be able to leverage capitals out there.  I'd spend time and energy on things that will generate cumulative revenue in the long run, even at the cost of short term financial gains. I would pick one sure-fire product and work on it hard.  On the same time, I want to diversify my energy onto a few other projects to keep myself from burning out and hopefully build a portfolio that can cancel out the inevitable up-and-downs that are out of my own control.</p>
<p>Third, to spend significant time improving myself.  To quote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: <em>You want to know how to paint a perfect painting?  It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.</em>  I'll spend some time on iOS and Object-C in 2013 but I would like to invest the majority of my learning time on soft skills like: to improve my writing skill, both in English and Chinese; to get a lot better at critical thinking, assess information and develop reasoned arguments; to hone my listening skill and be able to communicate my thoughts in a clear and succinct manner. I have long term interests in education and life science and health. I am sitting on the board of two companies in these fields.  I want to to spend more time understanding these two industries and hopefully position myself in the game for a long term success.</p>
<p>2013, we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>To be bluntly honest, my knowledge in economic and financial policy is quite shallow.  I have yet understood how everything is hooked up together and how pulling one string here might trigger some consequences in other places.  I don't have the illusion that I could one day be able to predict what's going to happen. All I want for now is to understand the basic questions.</p>
<p>Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why modern countries no longer uses the golden standard?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is money anyway? Is it a repository or a vehicle to hold value or a pure tool that governments uses to achieve some economic results?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With so many appalling "crimes" Wall Street scientists committed using fiat money, what alternatives out there that offer a more solid ground for an international currency, if it's not USD anymore?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course the core question, shall I suggest my relatives to buy gold instead of USD?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This short book offers some sound answers. I'm sure only time will know which parts are true and which need further adjustments.</p>
<p>The book comes with roughly 3 parts.</p>
<p>The first part is to lay out the reality on where we are in terms of currency and the naive claim that goes back to gold-standard will fix all problems. I personally found this part to be least interesting. I think any avid reader of the Economists magazine will find the contents here rather familiar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is on the credibility of governments that confidence in money has fully depended since 1971, when President Richard Nixon finally broke the link between gold and the dollar. Gold's rise has been the consequence of this crisis of confidence in the paper promises of governments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the advocates of this precious metal distract attention from the debate we need about how to restore the soundness of fiat money.</p>
<p>The second part provides the history of gold, which I enjoyed tremendously.  So it turns out that Silver is probably more widely used as a currency instead of Gold. Also, the gold-standard adopted by Britain was a side-effect from Sir Issac Newton's calculation error.  It also lays out the process where wars forced western countries to keep deviating from gold standard and trade-inbalance ends up severing the link between dollar and gold.</p>
<p>From the evolutionary biology point of view, the separation of currency and gold is a natural step in the long and ongoing evolution process for money.  Money is taking up a dual role as both the container for value as well as a tool for modern governments to affect economic activities. The conflicts between these two roles is where most of the debates come from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is not something absolute. It is a technology that has changed over millennia to meet our evolving need for a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value. That technology has had to adapt to changes in the real world. The rise of democracy drove the abandonment of the gold standard as a monetary system that, though it protected the value of money, was too rigid for modern welfare states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For cash strapped governments through the centuries the answer was obvious: find ways to create more money. The first ruler on record to do this, in or around 400 BC, was Dionysius of Syracuse, who was stuck in a long and expensive war with the powerful trading empire of Carthage in North Africa. His coffers bare, he called in all the 1 drachma coins in circulation, on pain of death, and restamped them as 2 drachma, thereby magically doubling the amount of money in the economy. Such 'debasement' of money — nowadays (allegedly) through quantitative easing rather than restamping coins — is not only of doubtful morality, since governments are in effect robbing from their subjects or citizens, but also tends to have bad consequences. It was a fear of the economic and social upheaval that might be caused by money losing its value that drove Britain to adopt "sound money"</p>
<p>The quick glimpse into the difference between John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek is fascinating as well. This is the first time that I finally understand where Keynes come from and get to appreciate his perspective. I'd certainly try to read more about these two person and their books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keynes, a gregarious and mercurial British intellectual, dazzled his peers with his brilliance and offered hope that even the seemingly most intractable economic problems could be solved by reasoning and, in certain circumstances, government action. Hayek, born in Vienna, was more pessimistic, warning of the excesses of big government and the inherent difficulty of top down economic policymaking. As he wrote in his last book, The Fatal Conceit, the "curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keynes looked at money in a different way to his predecessors in economic thinking. Rather than judging money simply in terms of how well it measures and stores value, Keynes took a broader, utilitarian view, asking how money influenced the behaviour of the economy as a whole. Money, he believed, should be judged not on whether it was sound or not but on whether it served the needs of the economy. If sound money was causing unemployment, as it was in the 1920s and 1930s, do not blame the unemployed, blame money.</p>
<p>One of the implications of this reimagining of money was that, rather than celebrating its role as a store of value over time, Keynes focused on how demand for it varied with the public's appetite for risk.</p>
<p>Instead of government-supplied fiat money, he (Hayek) argued, there should be privately-created money. Guided by self-interest rather than politics, this would be free from the distortions of government money. Money, he believed, should be as freely traded as any other product or service. Thanks to the wisdom of the invisible hand of the market, which always exceeds the skill of the bureaucrat, money would become smarter, more efficient and more reliable. Governments might still choose to issue currencies, but these would only remain in circulation, he predicted, if citizens found them to be reliable stores of value. Market discipline would drive out unreliable money and promote sound money. (This looks a bit like how America ran its money before the Legal Tender Act of 1862 made the dollar a government monopoly.)</p>
<p>The third part is, in my own words, cases for buying gold.  The book lists 3 potential scenarios where most of them would be a good case, but not an absolute one, for diversifying investments by buying in gold, which I found a quite natural and not very surprising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This case for gold is, we believe, very different from the one offered by gold fundamentalists. The current resurgence of gold may be understood best not as a return to "true money", nor, indeed, the beginning of the revival of a barbarous relic, but as part of the latest phase of innovation in the technology of money. It will not be the last.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the government deficit swells, and the political costs involved in cutting it by either spending less or taxing more grow ever larger, the temptation for politicians to reach for the inflation button may prove irresistible. The details of exactly how it would be done would no doubt remain murky: a technical rule change here by the Fed or the Treasury, a dismissal of a high inflation number as a one off there. Just as it has asserted its commitment to a strong dollar while pursuing policies that seem designed to weaken it, the US government would no doubt proclaim that it is determined to win the 'War on Higher Prices' even as it opens the monetary spigot ever wider.</p>
<p>The resurgence of gold needs to be taken seriously by us all, because of what it tells us about the economic challenges now facing our world and the effectiveness (or lack of it) of our efforts to tackle them.</p>
<p>Money is a matter of faith. Bits of paper and computer bytes change hands billions of times a day as a measure of value because we trust the promise that they represent. In today's era of fiat money, those promises rest ultimately on a guarantee by governments that they are valuable.
If you are looking for signals to buy gold as a hedge against a government-driven policy of inflation, one would be a lack of serious debate about deficit reduction during the 2012 presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>The book also covers a little bit on alternative currencies and bitcoin but I found its effort rather shallow and lack of anything that's truly new or inspirational.  It also talks about a syndicate of multiple currencies into an international currency, an idea from Hayek, but it faces so many challenges that I wouldn't even think it's possible.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a role model.  Mine is Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor clothing company Patagonia.   He is the type of entrepreneur who insists that he wants to<strong> do things on my own terms</strong>.  As a successful business man, he starts the book by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been a businessman for almost fifty years. It's as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or a lawyer.  I've never respected the profession. It's business that has to take the majority of the blame for being the enemy of nature, for destroying native cultures, for taking from the poor and giving to the rich, and for poisoning the earth with the effluent from its factories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet business can produce food, cure disease, control population, employ people, and generally enrich our lives. And it can do these good things and make a profit without losing its soul. That's what this book is about.</p>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> that attitude.</p>
<p>The book starts by going through the history of Patagonia, its early "by climber, for climber" root. It's great detail to product's quality. It's "simplify" philosophy. Then it goes on to explain the crisis of Patagonia, the credit crisis and the soul searching part.</p>
<p>Then it dives into the 8 philosophies of Patagonia. As a software entrepreneur, I found his "Product Design", "Production", "Image", "Human Resource" and "Management" are of particular interest to me. ( Yes, the environmental philosophy is so well known that, as a nature lover, I consider it to be common sense. Although I believe it's not a case for most people. ) As usual, here are some great quotes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Make the best product" is the raison d'etre of Patagonia and the cornerstone of our business philosophy.  Striving to make the best quality product is the reason we got into business in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify, simplify. - H.D. Thoreau
One "simplify" would have sufficed. - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>Weight quality first, against on-time delivery and low cost. A more sales-driven company might sacrifice a degree of quality to achieve on-time delivery, and a mass marketer might sacrifice both quality and on-time delivery to maintain the lowest cost.  Patagonia puts quality first, period.
Of course, if you do choose quality <em>against</em> on-time delivery or <em>against</em> paying a reasonable price, don't pat yourself on the back.  You've already blown it. You have to strive constantly to achieve all three, but quality is "more equal".</p>
<p>A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation.  He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both. - Francois Auguste Rene Chateaubriand</p>
<p>We don't hire the kind of people you can order around, like the foot soldiers in an army who charge from their foxholes without question when their sergeant yells, "Let's go, boys!" We want the kind of employee who will question the wisdom of something he regards as a bad  decision. We do want people who, once they buy into a decision and believe in what they are doing, will work like demons to produce something of the highest possible quality.</p>

<p>We are certainly living in an interesting time.  Besides all the financial crisis looming on the horizon, there are some fundamental challenges facing all the countries, that is <strong>unemployment because of technology advancement</strong>. In Spain, 60% people under 35 are unemployed. Despite all the seemingly good new, US is still losing job positions. But this time, it's not because of outsourcing to China or India, but because more and more jobs have been replaced by robots.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="201"]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI"><img alt="" src="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cover-201x300.jpg"></a> Race Against The Machine $3.99[/caption]</p>
<p>This book is written by two professors from <a href="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/authors/">MIT Centre for Digital Business</a>. This thin book really discussed two things: most jobs today will be replaced by robots and how we can cope with that.</p>
<p>First, many of the mid-range jobs done by human being will be replaced by robots. This is the same thing that has happened to the horses in 19th century and bank tellers before ATM was introduced.  This has become very obvious when the recent economic recovery in US has seen strong growth yet no job has been created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grim unemployment statistics puzzled many because other measures of business health rebounded pretty quickly after the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009. GDP growth averaged 2.6% in the seven quarters after the recession’s end, a rate 75% as high as the long-term average over 1948-2007. U.S. corporate profits reached new records. And by 2010, investment in equipment and software returned to 95% of its historical peak, the fastest recovery of equipment investment in a generation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most economists aren't taking these worries very seriously. The idea that computers might significantly disrupt human labor markets—and, thus, further weaken the global economy—so far remains on the fringes.</p>
<p>College graduates who seek the traditional type of job, where someone else tells them what to do each day, will find themselves increasingly in competition with machines, which excel at following detailed instructions</p>
<p>The root of our problems is not that we’re in a Great Recession, or a Great Stagnation, but rather that we are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, the stagnation of median incomes primarily reflects a fundamental change in how the economy apportions income and wealth. The median worker is losing the race against the machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, the authors suggest that the only way we human being can win this battle "against" the machine is to work side-by-side with the machine. As a society,  it's time for another good shake to some fundamental things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best chess player is a team of humans using computers.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the computer, like all general purpose technologies, requires parallel innovation in business models, organizational processes structures, institutions, and skills. These intangible assets, comprising both organizational and human capital, are often ignored on companies’ balance sheets and in the official GDP statistics, but they are no less essential than hardware and software.</p>
<p>The most productive firms reinvented and reorganized decision rights, incentives systems, information flows, hiring systems, and other aspects of organizational capital to get the most from the technology. This, in turn, required radically different and, generally, higher skill levels in the workforce</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Education</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also enables unbundling of instruction, evaluation, and certification, which encourages educational systems to be based more on delivering genuine, measurable results and less on simply signaling selection, effort, and prestige.</p>
<p>Combining videoconferencing, software, and networks with local teachers and tutors has a number of potential advantages. The very best “superstar” teachers can be “replicated” via technology, giving more students a chance to learn from them.In particular, softer skills like leadership, team building, and creativity will be increasingly important.</p>

<p>Luckily he has an answer and it’s a good one: <strong>“Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it”. </strong></p>
<p>This then is Principle Two for the successful optimist. All successful optimists have a project that is bigger than they are. By contrast, people who have a project that is the same size as themselves are invariably miserable and tedious company. Once you’ve got a bigger car/ nicer house/ television bigger than God what’s left? As so many find out, eventually the answer is a nagging emptiness accompanied by the thought, “Surely there must be more to life than this?”</p>
<p>Those with something bigger than themselves generally derive a deep-in-the-core happiness from whatever that is.<strong> It’s a happiness that comes from a feeling you have a place in the world.</strong> A ‘bigger than me’ project can be your family, your religion, military service or a scientific calling. You don’t have to agree with another person’s ‘bigger than me’ project but it is true that people who have them are usually more driven, positive and able to get things done as a result. This is a happiness different from the passing pleasures of a good night out or great joke, and it will not manifest itself as merriment, but its motivating power is fundamental to the successful optimist.</p>
