        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Have had my own humble share of fund raising, shake the hands of investors from China, US and Australia, the following article left a deep impression on me.  For anyone who is raising capital, please keep this one in mind.   To be fair, the most successful investors start out as entrepreneurs, like Ben Horowitz, Mark Anderson. But there are also non-trivial pencentage of investors who just haven't done it before.  When they give advices, I frown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of startups, it’s convenient to read the Picasso quote as a tidy summarization of the difference between critics (VCs and the tech press) and practitioners (entrepreneurs). There is some truth to this. When entrepreneurs get together, they tend to talk about tactical details. VCs and the press talk about trends, markets, and other abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Picasso was just being modest. He thought about the meaning of his art far more deeply than his critics did. The same is true of great entrepreneurs. “Cheap turpentine” is important, but so is “Form and Structure and Meaning”. The best ideas emerge from the interplay between the two modes of thought.</p>

<p>Future usually unfolds itself bit-by-bit. And here is another crack.</p>
<p>I have long heard of the term "computational photography" where techniques like linear algebra could be used to transform one shape into another. But to see it in effect is still mind numbing. Checkout the following video where using open source software,  "people are removed from a space".  Think of surveillance devices. Think about using photo and video as evidences in court. We're truly living in an exciting time.</p>

<p>Through a process of foreground subtraction, the project removes people from a space which otherwise would be difficult to capture empty. Using either time-lapse sequences, movie scenes, or live video as the content, users are able to watch as the people begin to fade away and the background is reconstructed. The video below shows the image as it is being processed.</p>

<p>Thinking back to my earliest involvement with Wired magazine and then launching HotWired (amazingly, almost 20 and 18 years ago respectively), I am continually impressed with how much fun the business of media can be. Media sites make for inherently cyclical, constantly transforming businesses where <strong>you’re only as good as the last story you pushed out. The people who contribute are the ultimate product — the media are just the messages.</strong> If I’ve learned anything in my few decades of experience in media, the hard part is hitching yourself to the right star.</p>

<p>We all know that building a startup team is hard yet crucial.  But given so many other factors that are involved in this brutal survival game, there hasn't been much research done on answering the question: <strong>what makes up the best team?</strong> Shall we pick a group of really talented people and put them together and wait it to settle down by itself? Or maybe find a team that has done works together since they know each other much better so communication cost and team coherency is better? If the reality is somewhere between these two extreme sides, where is the balance point?</p>
<p>Finally I ran into one <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all">great and long article</a> on this topic.  The article itself has many parts to it and it's not as smooth as it could be. But there are so many nuggets it it that I strongly recommend you reading it from cover to cover.</p>
<p>Here is the answer for those impatient ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uzzi found that the people who worked on Broadway were part of a social network with lots of interconnections: it didn’t take many links to get from the librettist of “Guys and Dolls” to the choreographer of “Cats.” Uzzi devised a way to quantify the density of these connections,<strong> a figure he called Q. If musicals were being developed by teams of artists that had worked together several times before</strong>—a common practice, because Broadway producers see “incumbent teams” as less risky—<strong>those musicals would have an extremely high Q</strong>. A musical created by a team of strangers would have a low Q.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uzzi then tallied his Q readings with information about how successful the productions had been. “Frankly, I was surprised by how big the effect was,” Uzzi told me. “I expected Q to matter, but I had no idea it would matter this much.” According to the data, the <strong>relationships among collaborators emerged as a reliable predictor of Broadway success.</strong> When the Q was low—less than 1.7 on Uzzi’s five-point scale—the musicals were likely to fail. Because the artists didn’t know one another, they struggled to work together and exchange ideas. “This wasn’t so surprising,” Uzzi says. “It takes time to develop a successful collaboration.” <strong>But, when the Q was too high (above 3.2), the work also suffered.</strong> The artists all thought in similar ways, which crushed innovation. According to Uzzi, this is what happened on Broadway during the nineteen-twenties, which he made the focus of a separate study. The decade is remembered for its glittering array of talent—Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II, and so on—but Uzzi’s data reveals that ninety per cent of musicals produced during the decade were flops, far above the historical norm. “Broadway had some of the biggest names ever,” Uzzi explains. “But the shows were too full of repeat relationships, and that stifled creativity.”</p>
<p><strong>The best Broadway shows were produced by networks with an intermediate level of social intimacy.</strong> The ideal level of Q—which Uzzi and his colleague Jarrett Spiro called the <strong>“bliss point”—emerged as being between 2.4 and 2.6.</strong> A show produced by a team whose Q was within this range was three times more likely to be a commercial success than a musical produced by a team with a score below 1.4 or above 3.2. It was also three times more likely to be lauded by the critics. “The best Broadway teams, by far, were those with a mix of relationships,” Uzzi says. “These teams had some old friends, but they also had newbies. This mixture meant that the artists could interact efficiently—they had a familiar structure to fall back on—but they also managed to incorporate some new ideas. They were comfortable with each other, but they weren’t too comfortable.”</p>
<p>Uzzi’s favorite example of “intermediate Q” is “West Side Story,” one of the most successful Broadway musicals ever. In 1957, the play was seen as a radical departure from Broadway conventions, both for its focus on social problems and for its extended dance scenes. The concept was dreamed up by Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, and Arthur Laurents. They were all Broadway legends, which might make “West Side Story” look like a show with high Q. But the project also benefitted from a crucial injection of unknown talent, as the established artists realized that they needed a fresh lyrical voice. After an extensive search, they chose a twenty-five-year-old lyricist who had never worked on a Broadway musical before. His name was Stephen Sondheim.</p>

<p>Amazon is a great company. So is Apple. Although they both have content, ie iTune vs. Amazon, or tablet device, iPad vs. Kindle. the two companies culture are dramatically different.  Their strategy to profit are different.</p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Twitter-_-alexdong_-Apple_s-goal-is-to-make-....jpg"><img alt="" src="http://alexdong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Twitter-_-alexdong_-Apple_s-goal-is-to-make-....jpg"></a></p>
<p>Daring Fireball's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/amazons_play">Amazon's Play </a>has summarized most of what I wanted to say about this. So I'll just quote him out right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s goal is to sell as many iPads as it can. <strong>Amazon’s goal is to sell as many Kindle Fires as it can to a specific audience: active Amazon.com customers.</strong> And for that specific audience, it’s a very appealing proposition. The <strong>Fire makes it even easier to do things you’re already doing</strong> — reading Kindle e-books, watching movies and TV shows through your Prime membership. And the low prices speak to the heart of the Amazon.com customer base. When Bezos says he wants Amazon’s interests aligned with those of their customers, he means it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s a <em>heads we win, tails you lose</em> strategy.</strong> That’s the brilliance. If you buy an iPad but use Amazon’s iOS apps to read Kindle books and watch movies through your Amazon Prime account, Apple wins but so too does Amazon. If you buy a Kindle Fire instead of an iPad, Apple gets nothing. Amazon wins so long as you consume media content from Amazon, no matter if you play it on a Kindle Fire or an iPad. Apple only wins if you buy an iPad.</p>
<p>ReadWriteWeb has one chart that shows the huge d<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the-difference-between-apple-amazon-in-one-chart.php">ifference Between Apple &amp; Amazon In One Chart</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/files/styles/610_0/public/fields/apple-amazon-profit-chart.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, if short-term profit is all that matters, Apple is winning by a mile. Apple has generated more than $73 billion of profit over the span of this chart, while Amazon is around $2 billion. Some of that has to do with the relative size of the companies; Apple is about three times bigger, sales-wise. But Apple's approach is still dramatically more profitable on a relative basis.</p>
<p>That said, there's also merit to Amazon's approach. By pricing its devices lower, it's potentially bringing its technologies to more people in different economic positions. Apple has lowered its pricing premium significantly over the years, but there are still potentially millions of people who could justify buying a $200 Kindle Fire but not a $400 iPad. Apple is now expected to launch a smaller, cheaper iPad, something it once suggested it wouldn't do - an action attributable in part to Amazon's success.</p>
<p>Will Amazon's approach ever lead to substantial profits? If Apple and Google are driving media and app prices lower, that leaves less room for Amazon to profit in the future. But Amazon is a multifaceted machine, ranging from digital media sales to paper-towel delivery. It's possible that getting customers all-in on Amazon's digital and Prime services will eventually lead to greater profits across the board.</p>

<p>The full article can be read <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120906/making-money-while-keeping-prices-low-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-explains-it-all-mostly/">here.</a> Two things stand out.</p>
<p>First, on <strong>long term view.</strong>  Jeff is famous for his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/business/at-amazon-jeff-bezos-talks-long-term-and-means-it.html?pagewanted=all">long term view</a> even in 1997 when Amazon just went public. Economist also has a profile about his <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21548487">10,000-year-clock and Blue Origin project</a>.  He famously said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people,” Mr. Bezos told reporter Steve Levy last month<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/ff_bezos/all/1"> in an interview in Wired</a>. “But if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow—and we’re very stubborn.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="380"]<img alt="" src="http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/09/amazon_bezos_d_crop.png"> Jeff Bezos at AllThingsD[/caption]</p>
<p>Talking about the Kindle Product series. Here is another excellent example on taking really long term view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In a previous interview, you said it takes five to seven years for a new business to either break even or become profitable. And you are now in year five of the Kindle.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bezos:</strong> True story. Typically, of course, they vary a bit. We are in year five, but actually you could say we are in year eight because we worked on the device — the Kindle one — three years before we launched it.</p>
<p>Another thing that goes against common wisdom is about focus. It's really dazzling that Amazon is competing with NetFlix on video streaming, Walmart on retail, Google/Apple on mobile and leading the AWS service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Anyone ever tell you that you have a focus problem?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bezos:</strong> Hahahaha! That’s so funny because my Montessori teacher used to have to pick me up and move me from one task to the next.</p>
<p><strong>So, no?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bezos: </strong>So, no, I have never been asked that question. But I know where that’s coming from. I would say we do have a different philosophy from other companies — another common phrase is “stick to your knitting.” <strong>Our approach is, if we have a good idea, and if it’s something we think customers would care about</strong>, like AWS or Kindle Fire, then we don’t ask why do this, <strong>we ask why not do this?</strong> We have a high bar for doing those things. We don’t want to do me-too things. The people we’ve attracted over time to Amazon want to be pioneers. They want to be inventors. They want to do new things.</p>
<p>Take away? Do what makes sense to one's own company and ignore what others have to say. Do the same thing everyone is doing is not going to make or break a company.</p>

        <h2>- code</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> had this perfect answer for this question at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565">StackOverflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to<strong> test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence</strong> (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don't typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don't test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I'm extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different people will have different testing strategies based on this philosophy, but that seems reasonable to me given the immature state of understanding of how tests can best fit into the inner loop of coding. Ten or twenty years from now we'll likely have a more universal theory of which tests to write, which tests not to write, and how to tell the difference. In the meantime, experimentation seems in order.</p>

<p>Every computer science or engineering graduate has learned the basics of relational database. This will certainly include some "advanced" skills like JOIN, or COUNT with GROUP BY, or sub-queries and probably certainly TRANSACTIONS. Students believe that they need to use these features in their real work.</p>
<p>How wrong!</p>
<p>Amazon's e-commerce site uses <a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/consistency-and-availability-in-amazons-dynamo/">key-value, consistent hashing</a> and "always-write-succeed", instead of transactions, as described in <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html">this ground-breaking paper</a>.  Reddit, one of the world's most popular site uses<a href="http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/reddits-database-has-two-tables/"> only two tables</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they keep a Thing Table and a Data Table. Everything in Reddit is a Thing: users, links, comments, subreddits, awards, etc. Things keep common attribute like up/down votes, a type, and creation date. The Data table has three columns: thing id, key, value. There’s a row for every attribute. There’s a row for title, url, author, spam votes, etc. When they add new features they didn’t have to worry about the database anymore. They didn’t have to add new tables for new things or worry about upgrades. Easier for development, deployment, maintenance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The price is you can’t use cool relational features. There are no joins in the database and you must manually enforce consistency. No joins means it’s really easy to distribute data to different machines. You don’t have to worry about foreign keys are doing joins or how to split the data up. Worked out really well. Worries of using a relational database are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>In the age of big data, it's very rare that the database these students will work on in the future will stay on only one disk. As soon as the data expands physical machine boundary, all <strong>those beautiful normalization,  join, sub-queries and transactions all become completely useless.</strong></p>
<p>To prepare the students for future, I strongly recommend the universities also teaching the students these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to denormalize databases.  Teach them redis. Get them to think about how NOT to use lock. Teach them the master and slave concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain how<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding+Introduction"> MongoDB's sharding</a> works.  Let students work out how to pick the right index and keys to shard on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment with Google App Engine, particularly the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/usingdatastore">DataStore</a> so the students know the basic of BigTable and think more carefully on how to pick the best row id.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play around with Riak.  Think about how <a href="http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html">vector clock</a> works. What the "<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html">eventual consistency</a>" really means.</p>
</li>
</ul>
