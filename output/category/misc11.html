<p>Ran into a few posts about startup traction and the concept of quant based market. Thought it might benefit some readers of this blog. (If you haven't read my previous post of <a href="http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/">distribution channels,</a> you should.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gabriel from DuckDuckGo has two nice articles on this topic.  "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">How to move the needle</a>" talks about traction for different growth period and "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">Traction mistakes</a>" lists 4 common mistakes people make. I have all four of them squarely.  This 50% time on product and 50% for traction parallel thinking is certainly the approach I'd take if I have a chance to do it again.   BTW, he is writing a <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">book</a> on this topic too. His co-author has a <a href="http://justinmares.com/thoughts-on-paul-grahams-growth/">recent review </a>on PG's "Startup = Growth" essay which echos what Gabriel has said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noah Kagan who did the original marketing work for mint.com has an interesting post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2010/07/15/quant-based-marketing-for-pre-launch-start-ups/">Quant Based Marketing</a>.  The basic idea is pretty simple. List all potential channels of incoming attention and conversion rate from day-0. Then follow through the list.  Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuTYwDzB4XSudGpFcE9lSWI4YzUwcnhKZnNoMktEdkE&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0">spreadsheet </a>for it. Worth a close look.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, I blogged about the<a href="http://alexdong.com/union-square-ventures-investment-thesis-explained/"> investment philosophy of USV</a> from NYC.   Here is a similar piece from the Colorado based Foundry Group.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2008/03/what-is-thematic-investing/">This article explains</a> 2 things: "what types of companies do you guys like to invest in? and what sectors do you find interesting?”Here is a quick excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our themes tend to be horizontal in nature and are often based on an underlying protocol, standard or market trend that we believe is on the cusp of widespread adoption that has the potential to drive a cycle of innovation and company creation for at least a five to ten year period. We try to focus on themes and their underlying technologies that are ready to be rolled out to consumers or the enterprise and are well beyond the science-experiment phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make this concrete, some examples of themes we are excited about presently and historically include email, RSS, the implicit web and human-computer interaction (HCI). Because themes are inherently horizontal, they have often have applications in the consumer and enterprise markets and can be delivered in myriad ways, whether it is via a web site, SaaS, a gadget, an appliance or good old-fashioned downloadable client or server software.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/themes/">detailed list of portfolio companies across 6 themes</a>.</p>

<p>There are two stereotyped perspective of investing. One assumes that every year, there are about 10 investment opportunities for the whole industry.  So the investor's main job is to locate those deals and be part of it.  The other insists that there are certain rules on how startup works. So they try to find/curate startups following those lines. These two views map quite nicely into Peter Thiel's <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/23787022006/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-14-notes-essay">2x2 matrix of determinate/indeterminate and optimistic/pessimistic of future</a>.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I'm firmly in the determinate/optimistic area but well aware that unknown and luck is still a major part of the game.  Without any control over the luck factor, the best startups can do is to figure out the "right model" and structure your company accordingly.</p>
<p>I have been looking for a concise, yet comprehensive, explanation of the key components for a successful start-up.  Yesterday, I finally stumble upon one.  Print this one out. Use it as a compass for your business.</p>

        <p>The clothesline paradox tells a lot about the value flow.  I believe the current way of measuring economic using GDP somewhat encourages the endless and blind churn to keep the growth. Not saying the growth is bad, it is not. But more along the line where we want to think carefully about whether we are really creating value or we are just keep running like a blinded mule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about a piece I read in Stuart Brand's, CoEvolution Quarterly back in 1975. It's called the "Clothesline Paradox." The author, Steve Baer, was talking about alternative energy. The thesis is simple: <strong>You put your clothes in the dryer, and the energy you use gets measured and counted. You hang your clothes on the clothesline, and it "disappears" from the economy.</strong> It struck me that there are a lot of things that we're dealing with on the Internet that are subject to the Clothesline Paradox. Value is created, but it's not measured and counted. It's captured somewhere else in the economy.</p>

<p>It took him a few years to get going on that, but once he started, there was no turning back.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are a little crazy. That’s a good thing. Some of us can’t do anything else, and can’t take a normal job- and <strong>if we did try to take one, no matter how good of a situation it is, we’d blow it up</strong>. I think having an experience like the one that Noah had at Facebook teaches a lot of different things- not just who we are, but also who we’re not. It’s lucky, in my opinion, that he had such a pivotal experience so early in his career. It means that he’s free, for the rest of his life, to pursue who he really wants to be. Everyone should share that kind of experience</p>

<p>It's not often for me to become interested in technology itself these days. But the discussion between git pull and git rebase has interested me a lot.  Not for its own technology details but more as a tool to either loose or strengthen an engineering culture.</p>
<p>git pull encourages a rather loose, relax and, in the long run, ad-hoc manner of team work.  This suits startup cultures quite well.   It's fast to learn and easy for people who migrate from older version controls like subversions to learn.  Engineers works on his own little branch. He has no reason to integrate with other people's code until the very end of one's little project is finished.  The commit history ends up having messages that describes more about the code and less about the reason and thinking behind this list of patches.  For example, if you happen to follow the resque project, you'll realize that <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque/commit/832fb9d696c4367ae17d99aaa2ef6b43268605c5">a commit message like this</a> is not really that helpful. 7 lines of changes.  One line comment without explaining why the 'destroy' is delayed.</p>
<p>git rebase encourages comparatively stricter engineering culture. One has to pay attention to not only his code, but also the commit histories.  Projects like linux kernel uses it to enforce a culture of <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html"> keep clean history</a>. Linus even wrote up what a good commit would look like <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface/blob/master/README#L161">here. </a>  I can see how this could be very helpful in a project where the code needs to be maintained 15 years later by totally different set of people.  A clean history, instead of a loose list of incremental functional changes, will provide more context in the long run.  As a sample,<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766"> check out this patch</a> by Linus for a firmware related patch. <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blobdiff;f=drivers/base/firmware_class.c;h=81541452887bd3ce5d868909e3fb753fb3d6b124;hp=e85763de928f096e46cbfd74abb69c064e5c2101;hb=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766;hpb=e1cc485262846dcad931bf85ee655cbbb815bfe6">4 lines</a> of changes, 8 lines of comments on the commit.</p>

<p>Think it's hard to keep a balanced life? Check this one out. The ex NASA Space Shuttle Flight Director wrote how he looked back on 2002 when he <a href="http://waynehale.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/ten-years-after-columbia-balancing-work-and-life/">seems to live a balanced life but end up costing people's life</a>. Certainly not directly but ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it; the job and all my extracurricular activities, it’s a wonder I had time to sleep.  I guarantee I wasn’t bored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this walk down memory lane is not about trying to impress you; no doubt you have had similarly active times in your own life.  The point is that we started to miss critical safety issues in 2001 and 2002.  In early 2003 we paid the price for that inattention.</p>
<p>So I ask you; in a high reliability organization, one which is engaged in risky, highly complex activities with cutting edge technology; how much time does any individual need to devote to making the activity successful and safe?</p>
<p>Nothing on my list of activities was a bad thing; without a doubt I was making a difference to my family and in my community.  Some life moments are inescapable; death of a beloved family member is one of those.  No matter how far in advance you see it coming, you can never be ready for that.</p>
<p>The old saying “all work and no play makes jack a dull boy” also bears elements of truth.  Time for recreation and reflection is necessary to do ones best.</p>
<p>But in spite of all of that rationalization, a decade later, the regret over not playing a more important role, one that would have prevented the Columbia tragedy, lays like a pall over my memories of those days.</p>
<p>He grew even bitter admitting that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in a High Reliability Organization, you have to pay attention.  The more extreme the risk, the more difficult the environment, the more complex the technology, the more attention you must pay.  But life intrudes.  As the song says, there are planes to catch and bills to pay, and too there are little children to play with.  You cannot work all the time, and if the balance gets too far either way, a price will be exacted.  Once upon a time I wrote:  “pay attention, do good work, have no regrets”.  True, but far too simplistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2002 I thought we were paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I thought I was paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I was a Flight Director.  I was also a husband and a father and active in my community.  I thought I could do it all.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So work was a 60 hour a week job; it was always on my mind.  There were a thousand details to plan and decide and brief to management.  Even then I recognized that there were a million details in the shuttle business that I couldn’t participate in; there just wasn’t enough time or energy for any one person to do it all.  The folks in the shuttle program office, Ron Dittemore, Linda Ham, and the rest, they had a tough job.  Tougher than you know.  Tougher than I knew at the time.  Everybody played their part, everybody was highly motivated, everybody wanted the shuttle to succeed, and yet, within months, we were all to fail.</p>
<p>Why?  Listen and learn.  Maybe you will avoid failure.  But don’t count on it.</p>

<p>I'd say the same is true for entrepreneurs. It usually takes at least 2-3 years for a young and fresh entrepreneur to hit his own stride and know what works for him the best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In listening to both of them, I heard something that I have found to be true in my own experience. It takes time to learn how to be an early stage investor. You have to make a bunch of investments and learn from them. And you have to develop a strategy, a thesis, and your own differentiated style which people can then attach to you. In effect you have to build a brand and become known for what you do and how you do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this happens overnight. I think it took my friend about four years to hit his stride. I suspect it took the Gotham Gal about as long. Part of this is that is how long it takes to know if you've made a good investment or not. You might know in two to three years. But by four years, it is going to be pretty clear. As these outcomes start coming in, you can start to see what is working and what is not.</p>
<p>And "what is working and what is not" is not just about your investment selection. <strong>It is about the fit between you and a certain kind of entrepreneur and a certain kind of target market and a certain kind of business model. Some investors are better at investing in SAAS companies. Some are better at investing in e-commerce. Some are better at investing in mobile apps. Some investors are better at working with teams that need a lot of help. Some investors are better at working with teams that don't need any help and want you to get out of the way.</strong></p>
<p>It is important to figure out who you are and where you fit in the startup economy before you can become a good investor. But once you do that, you can "hit your stride" and start investing with conviction.</p>
