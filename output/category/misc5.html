<p><a href="https://twitter.com/history_pics/status/352157239118802945">Kamikaze pilots play with a puppy, before their flights. 1945</a>: War time stories tend to paint a black and white picture of enemies.  But really it's just people. They smile. They huddle their pets. They are young, shy and thought they were dying for a purpose. </p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/look-what-i-made/58f85583d843">A Stage Coach To The Stars</a>: This article discussed the idea of building a spacecoach, a fully reusable interplanetary spacecraft whose mass is mostly water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that water is highly desirable in an interplanetary spacecraft, not just for life support (for people and plants), but can be used for many purposes on a long flight, including radiation shielding (its comparable to lead on a per kilogram basis), thermal regulation (its an excellent heat sink), oxygen generation (via electrolysis), attitude control (by pumping water around ring shaped reservoirs) and propulsion (water vapor can be heated to very high temperatures in microwave electrothermal engines to produce thrust several times more efficiently than chemical rockets). Water is also easy to handle, meaning the craft can be resupplied as needed, something that is much more difficult to do with chemical rocket fuels, especially cryogenic fuels.
[...]
None of this is to say that this would be easy to do, but the technology needed to build these ships exists and improves with each year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the approaches used to identify spam goes like this; if I see a spam message at 8:30 in the morning, I send a checksum of that message to an online database of spam. When you get that message a little later on in the morning, your mail system asks that online database, "Has anyone reported this as spam?". The online database can report back "yes", allowing your mail system to raise the spam score for that message.</p>

<p>0%: Open your iPhone. Search for “Italian Food." What do you see? If you’re in NYC, you see 0 organic results. You see an ad unit taking half the page, and then a Google owned Zagat listing. Start scrolling, you’ll see a map, then Google local listings. After four full page scrolls, you’ll have the organic listings in front of you.

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/06/19/kierkegaard-on-anxiety-and-creativity/">Kierkegaard on Anxiety &amp; Creativity</a>. 
Søren Kierkegaard argues like anxiety comes naturally with the ability to create. Anxiety often triggers another emotion guilty. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rollo May dived into the guilty part deeper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>creating also means destroying the status quo of one’s environment, breaking the old forms; it means producing something new and original in human relations as well as in cultural forms (e.g., the creativity of the artist). Thus every experience of creativity has its potentiality of aggression or denial toward other persons in one’s environment or established patterns within one’s self. 
The more creative the person, he held, the more anxiety and guilt are potentially present.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as a journalist and activist, Mr. Greenwald could not resist a jab. “I have seen all sorts of so-called objective journalists who have all kinds of assumptions in every sentence they write,” he said. “Rather than serve as an adversary of government, they want to bolster the credibility of those in power. That is a classic case of a certain kind of activism.”</p>

Ad supported: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made on average $2,100 a month. My stats were 50,000 uniques and 150,000 page views a month with 8,200 subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After paywall and the $40/year membership fee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how many members do I have? Roughly 255 right now. Again, I don’t know if that is good or horrible. It amounts to a little less than $1,000 a month after fees and such. So less than half of what I was making before.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will he keeps on having the paywall? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that the member base is very stable. That I barely gain new members each month, and likely if I want to up the membership I will need to talk about the membership more. Since putting up the paywall I’ve been able to stop caring about stats and money. All I focus on is writing and that’s way better. Yes there is a little bit of support, but far less than the work it took to fill RSS slots, or mentally think about keeping up page views to try and get better ad rates.</p>

<p><a href="http://henryr.github.io/cap-faq/">The CAP FAQ</a>: CAP is one of those fundamental concept I hope more engineers understand, no matter which kind of database technology you use. MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak. They are all trying to accomplish at most two of the three properties as defined by CAP. I can't imagine a civilized and in-depth discussion on database technology without knowing the other party has a solid grasp of the CAP theory.</p>
<p><a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/06/19/frequency-trails/">Frequency Trails</a>: What's fascinating about this is the comparison with heatmap and the affordance of color and line in data visualization tasks. <em>Frequency trails are [...] developed to study the finer details of hundreds of measured latency distributions from production servers, and in particular, to study latency outliers. ... Frequency trails use height to show the frequency of data rather than color, and provide higher resolution for outliers. Subtle details can be more easily seen by small variations in height, rather than small variations in color saturation.</em></p>

It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified. It assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them. Their authority is not self-justifying. They have to give a reason for it, a justification. And if they can't justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just. ... Well what's called libertarian in the United States, which is a special U. S. phenomenon, it doesn't really exist anywhere else -- a little bit in England -- permits a very high level of authority and domination but in the hands of private power: so private power should be unleashed to do whatever it likes.</em></p>

JavaScript should win; Dart is bad! But then I came to realize the Dart guys aren’t just setting out to improve the authoring and scalability of web application development. They also really want the web to win. Now I’ve recently spoke about how The Mobile Web Is In Trouble, and clarified that my priorities are seeing it provide a fantastic user experience to everyone. For me, seeing the mobile web be successful trumps language wars and certainly quibbling over syntax. So I’m happy to see developers embrace the authoring advantages of Coffeescript, the smart subset of JavaScript strict mode, the legendary Emscripten &amp; asm.js combo, the compiler feedback of TypeScript and the performance ambitions of Dart. It’s worth trying out technologies that can leapfrog the current expectations of the user experience that we can deliver. Our web is worth it.</em></p>

<p>Like <a href="http://alexdong.com/ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/">I said</a>, I feel let down by the iOS 7 design.  It is not that Apple won't be able to get the contrasts right or they can't nail the design details. It is not that this does not open up a whole new trend of design that focuses on content, which I agree is a good thing. It is about what is Apple. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/">Designed by Apple</a> is fine. I love Apple's product because they are beautiful and such a joy to use. But down in my heart, <strong>I see Apple as a technology company, not a design company</strong>.  Macintosh made it possible for normal people to run VisiCalc at home.  iPhone offered GPS and high-def camera which enabled a whole range of innovations/industries. These are the things I am looking for on a technology platform provider. </p>
<p>The following comment from HackerNews summarized my thoughts perfectly. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yay change for change's sake.</p>
<p>This is exactly the wrong attitude in my opinion. How does it help users to all of a sudden have most apps feel ancient? Is it really something to be proud of? That for the next year we'll be working on replacing existing utilities so that they feel "right" and "fresh" instead of doing what we should be doing: thinking of actual new software that is worthwhile to write.</p>
<p>I've been saying this for a while but I think what is happening, and what many developers haven't noticed yet, is that we have exhausted the utility of software for software's sake. The interesting stuff happening in mobile now has nothing to do with "design" in the traditional sense any more. Its not enough to just have a coder and a designer on the team. The really cool stuff is all about what your phone actually allows you to do in the real world. Look at apps like uber, postmates, spotify, and twitch.tv. Most of these have terrible UI's, but that's not the point. The point is that they allow you to do things. I can have a car on my doorstep! I can listen to almost any song I want. They're not just another calculator app or news reader, so who cares if its not the prettiest or easiest thing to use in the world. They are an interface to actually useful services. Software was interesting on its own a decade ago, but the industry has grown up, its time to do things now. That doesn't mean that "UI and UX" don't matter, it just means their definition changes and grows beyond just how you tap things on glass and what pixels you choose to animate.</p>
<p>The reason that iOS 7 seems comforting in the way its described in this article is because it gives developers who haven't realized this something to do again. Marco is absolutely right, for a long time it has felt like all the major categories have been covered on the app store. That's a good thing! It means we've solved lots of problems. We shouldn't daydream of a day when those problems get artificially unsolved so we can have another shot at them. We should move on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back to the present - it pains me to see such a lack of transparency in how our elected officials are running our government. Of course, the common man knows it's common sense that there's an inherent need for secrecy in conducting small scale covert operations. We do get it.
However, it's also common sense that it's inevitable that any complex large-scale long-term operation will ultimately come to light. And so it's just common sense that any such broad-based operations that might be perceived as impacting our constitutional rights should be the subject of broad public debate. No, not when they're being prototyped or tested or used in small scale settings - but definitely somewhere on the path from "tactical use" to "broad strategic dependence".</p>
<p>These are not small issues, nor need they be at all partisan. Wyden, Paul, and others are trying. Theses issues are fundamental to defining the relationship between us citizens and our government in the decades ahead.
In particular, in this world where "SaaS" and "software eats everything" and "cloud computing" and "big data" are inevitable and already pervasive, it pains me to see how 3rd Party Doctrine may now already be being leveraged to effectively gut the intent of U.S. citizens' Fourth Amendment rights. Don't we need a common-sense refresh to the wording of our laws and potentially our constitution as it pertains to how we now rely upon 3rd parties? It makes zero sense in a "services age" where granting third parties limited rights to our private information is so basic and fundamental to how we think, work, conduct and enjoy life.
For example, did you really intend to yield your 4th amendment rights when you granted a 3rd party access to your files as a part of Mac Software Update, Windows Update, Virus Scanners, etc., or when you started using a service-tethered smartphone?</p>
<p>Anyway, unlike 'web tracking' issues which seem to be broadly ignored because of our love for ad-supported services, I hope we all (especially the young readers of reddit, hackernews, etc) wake up to the fact that these privacy and transparency issues are REAL, and that they truly will impact you and the country you live in, and that even if you don't consider yourself an activist you really should get informed and form an opinion. Again, this is a non-partisan issue, and let's all work to ensure that it stays this way.</p>
<p>Two great organizations where you can learn are EPIC and EFF. (Disclosure: I am on the board of EPIC.) Take it in, and think. Your contributions are needed and would of course be quite welcome.</p>

<p>Yesterday I posted the link on Google's new photo search and how "deep learning" makes that possible.  Here are some weekend reads on this topic.  The two videos focusing on different aspect of this concept. The first one explains the concept and the implication. The second talk covers how to use a large distributed computing model to train the multiple layers. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">What is Deep learning</a>: <em>Deep learning is set of algorithms in machine learning that attempt to learn layered models of inputs, commonly neural networks. The layers in such models correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where higher-level concepts are defined from lower-level ones, and the same lower-level concepts can help to define many higher-level concepts.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2538">Deep learning - The Biggest Data Science Breakthrough of the Decade</a> (60m video): This one talks more about the historical context and the Kaggle machine learning platform. Not particularly technically challenging but interesting enough since it provides lots of the applications of this technology. <em>Machine learning and AI have appeared on the front page of the New York Times three times in recent memory: 1) When a computer beat the world's #1 chess player 2) When Watson beat the world's best Jeopardy players 3) When deep learning algorithms won a chemo-informatics Kaggle competition. We all know about the first two... but what's that deep learning thing about?</em></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/52332329">Tera-scale deep learning - Quoc V. Le</a> (60m video): <em>Deep learning and unsupervised feature learning offer the potential to transform many domains such as vision, speech, and NLP. However, these methods have been fundamentally limited by our computational abilities, and typically applied to small-sized problems. In this talk, I describe the key ideas that enabled scaling deep learning algorithms to train a very large model on a cluster of 16,000 CPU cores (2000 machines). This network has 1.15 billion parameters, which is more than 100x larger than the next largest network reported in the literature.</em> (via: <a href="http://datascience101.wordpress.com">data science 101</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.nz/2013/06/improving-photo-search-step-across.html">Improving Photo Search: A Step Across the Semantic Gap</a>: To be able to search for a photo without up-front labeling has been a dream until recently Google reported a doubled average precision. Two things make this break-through possible. First, the <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/large_deep_networks_nips2012.html">ability</a> (pdf) to <em>training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores</em>. Second, the training now uses <a href="http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Entity">Freebase entities</a> to form the basis of <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html">knowledge graph</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sigmetrics.org/sigmetrics2013/pdfs/p93.pdf">Root Cause Detection in a Service-Oriented Architecture</a> [pdf] Like <a href="http://codeascraft.com/2013/06/11/introducing-kale/">Etsy's Loupe/Kale</a>.  <em>An anomalous change in a metric of one service can propagate to other services during this communication, resulting in overall degradation of the request. ... A modern website is usually composed of hundreds of services running on thousands of machines in multiple data centers. This paper introduces MonitorRank, an algorithm that can reduce the time, domain knowledge, and human effort required to find the root causes of anomalies in such service-oriented architectures. In the event of an anomaly, MonitorRank provides a ranked order list of possible root causes for monitoring teams to investigate. MonitorRank uses the historical and current time-series metrics of each sensor as its input, along with the call graph generated between sensors to build an unsupervised model for ranking.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://vintagemacmuseum.com/the-enduring-appeal-of-macintosh-picasso-artwork/">The Enduring Appeal of Macintosh Picasso Artwork</a>: I am happily surprised to see that even as early as 1984, Steve Jobs has already got a strong, long lasting and consistent brand image nailed. This is used all the way into mid 1990s. <em>The famous Macintosh Picasso logo was developed for the introduction of the original 128k Mac back in 1984. A minimalist line drawing in the style of Pablo Picasso, this whimsical graphic implied the whole of a computer in a few simple strokes. It was an icon of what was inside the box, and became as famous as the computer it represented. It’s been beloved ever since, and the graphic style has endured across decades.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/06/music-industry">On-demand touring</a>: <em>Fans still crave going to shows, yet increased digital access has led to slumps in live concert attendance. many complain that the process of acquiring tickets is increasingly frustrating.  Services like Detour ... Services like Detour have determined that fans are more than willing to leave the house for a live-music experience, if someone will simply organise that experience well.</em></p>
