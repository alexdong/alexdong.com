        <h2>- strategy</h2>
<p>The full article can be read <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120906/making-money-while-keeping-prices-low-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-explains-it-all-mostly/">here.</a> Two things stand out.</p>
<p>First, on <strong>long term view.</strong>  Jeff is famous for his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/business/at-amazon-jeff-bezos-talks-long-term-and-means-it.html?pagewanted=all">long term view</a> even in 1997 when Amazon just went public. Economist also has a profile about his <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21548487">10,000-year-clock and Blue Origin project</a>.  He famously said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people,” Mr. Bezos told reporter Steve Levy last month<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/ff_bezos/all/1"> in an interview in Wired</a>. “But if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow—and we’re very stubborn.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talking about the Kindle Product series. Here is another excellent example on taking really long term view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In a previous interview, you said it takes five to seven years for a new business to either break even or become profitable. And you are now in year five of the Kindle.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bezos:</strong> True story. Typically, of course, they vary a bit. We are in year five, but actually you could say we are in year eight because we worked on the device — the Kindle one — three years before we launched it.</p>
<p>Another thing that goes against common wisdom is about focus. It's really dazzling that Amazon is competing with NetFlix on video streaming, Walmart on retail, Google/Apple on mobile and leading the AWS service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Anyone ever tell you that you have a focus problem?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bezos:</strong> Hahahaha! That’s so funny because my Montessori teacher used to have to pick me up and move me from one task to the next.</p>
<p><strong>So, no?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bezos: </strong>So, no, I have never been asked that question. But I know where that’s coming from. I would say we do have a different philosophy from other companies — another common phrase is “stick to your knitting.” <strong>Our approach is, if we have a good idea, and if it’s something we think customers would care about</strong>, like AWS or Kindle Fire, then we don’t ask why do this, <strong>we ask why not do this?</strong> We have a high bar for doing those things. We don’t want to do me-too things. The people we’ve attracted over time to Amazon want to be pioneers. They want to be inventors. They want to do new things.</p>
<p>Take away? Do what makes sense to one's own company and ignore what others have to say. Do the same thing everyone is doing is not going to make or break a company.</p>

        <h2>- code</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> had this perfect answer for this question at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565">StackOverflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to<strong> test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence</strong> (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don't typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don't test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I'm extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different people will have different testing strategies based on this philosophy, but that seems reasonable to me given the immature state of understanding of how tests can best fit into the inner loop of coding. Ten or twenty years from now we'll likely have a more universal theory of which tests to write, which tests not to write, and how to tell the difference. In the meantime, experimentation seems in order.</p>

<p>Every computer science or engineering graduate has learned the basics of relational database. This will certainly include some "advanced" skills like JOIN, or COUNT with GROUP BY, or sub-queries and probably certainly TRANSACTIONS. Students believe that they need to use these features in their real work.</p>
<p>How wrong!</p>
<p>Amazon's e-commerce site uses <a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/consistency-and-availability-in-amazons-dynamo/">key-value, consistent hashing</a> and "always-write-succeed", instead of transactions, as described in <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html">this ground-breaking paper</a>.  Reddit, one of the world's most popular site uses<a href="http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/reddits-database-has-two-tables/"> only two tables</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they keep a Thing Table and a Data Table. Everything in Reddit is a Thing: users, links, comments, subreddits, awards, etc. Things keep common attribute like up/down votes, a type, and creation date. The Data table has three columns: thing id, key, value. There’s a row for every attribute. There’s a row for title, url, author, spam votes, etc. When they add new features they didn’t have to worry about the database anymore. They didn’t have to add new tables for new things or worry about upgrades. Easier for development, deployment, maintenance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The price is you can’t use cool relational features. There are no joins in the database and you must manually enforce consistency. No joins means it’s really easy to distribute data to different machines. You don’t have to worry about foreign keys are doing joins or how to split the data up. Worked out really well. Worries of using a relational database are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>In the age of big data, it's very rare that the database these students will work on in the future will stay on only one disk. As soon as the data expands physical machine boundary, all <strong>those beautiful normalization,  join, sub-queries and transactions all become completely useless.</strong></p>
<p>To prepare the students for future, I strongly recommend the universities also teaching the students these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to denormalize databases.  Teach them redis. Get them to think about how NOT to use lock. Teach them the master and slave concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain how<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding+Introduction"> MongoDB's sharding</a> works.  Let students work out how to pick the right index and keys to shard on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment with Google App Engine, particularly the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/usingdatastore">DataStore</a> so the students know the basic of BigTable and think more carefully on how to pick the best row id.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play around with Riak.  Think about how <a href="http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html">vector clock</a> works. What the "<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html">eventual consistency</a>" really means.</p>

<p>Today I had a chat with one of our most talented engineers who could code front-end animation effect that I wouldn't even believe it's possible.   When I started programming, it was assembly. Then c, c++, java/c#.  The new generation of programmers, however, start with html/javascript.</p>
<p>You know, the high level stuff.</p>
<p>When I asked him what he would love to play with, his answer was node.js. And that is worrying.  It's not that node.js is not cool.  Or it's not fast. Rather, it's the lack of the understanding of both <strong>low-level stuff</strong> like paging and locking, which one can only learn by programming in C,  and <strong>functional programming</strong> stuffs that allow building a complex system using macro and chain-up-functions.  So here is what I would recommend a junior engineer to read:</p>
<p>To have a firm grasp of low level programming concepts. <strong>Read the redis source code</strong> and read the common unix system calls.  <a href="http://pauladamsmith.com/articles/redis-under-the-hood.html">Redis: under the hood</a> and <a href="http://www.enjoythearchitecture.com/redis-architecture">Redis Architecture</a> are two excellent resources to get started. Alternatively, read <a href="http://www.nginxguts.com/">nginx</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish_cache">varnish</a> source code, which is reasonable well written too.</p>
<p>To appreciate the beauty and power of functional programming,<strong> learn yourself some <a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/">clojure</a> or erlang.</strong> Clojure is more robust as a functional programming language with excellent jvm support. <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do">Erlang,</a> on the other hand, offers a great lesson on how to construct a robust distributed concurrent system. This lesson will still hold true even if you're coding in C.  Like the <a href="http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.co.nz/2012/08/getting-25-megalines-of-code-to-behave.html">Curiosity on Mars</a>.</p>

<p>Startup life is stressful. Whether you're the founder or the employee.  Facing uncertainty everyday will drain your passion and energy.  Slowly but surely, you will wake up one day morning and feel like doing nothing. Everything seems to be broken. The whole universe seems to evolve against you.  You could literally stare at the monitor for a while and forgot what you want to do.   Experienced entrepreneurs will take the pace very carefully so that they could have a sustainable productive day-after-day. Rookies will throw two 100-hour weeks and burned out for another.</p>
<p>I have been there many times. My first serious burn-out was so overwhelming that I almost gave up programming. I ended up traveling for 10 months before I recover and found interests in programming/startup again.  There have been many guides on "<a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-startup-founders-deal-with-burnout">how</a> <a href="http://www.inc.com/guides/growth/20792.html">to</a> avoid burn out". But the essence is the same. Indulge in something. Do something that's luxurious for time-poor people.  The harder you push yourself to focus on work and put down other parts of life, the stronger the bounce off will become.</p>
<p>Today I <a href="http://danariely.com/2012/08/15/understanding-ego-depletion/">ran across this post</a> from a behavioral economist.   The research is about junk food and weight loss.  But the lesson can easily apply to entrepreneurs.  Dan first defined the concept of "ego depletion"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, when we’ve said “no” to enough yummy food, drinks, potential purchases, and forced ourselves to do enough unwanted chores, we find ourselves in a state called <strong>ego-depletion</strong>, where we don’t have any more energy to make good decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the solution. Tl;dr: indulge yourself in something that's considered unhealthy, unproductive just to refill the bucket. Or just say to yourself: f**k it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/7769306054_42541331ce.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how can we escape depletion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A friend of mine named Dan Silverman once suggested an interesting approach during our time together at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, which is a delightful place for researchers to take a year off to think, plan, and eat very well. Every day, after a rich lunch, we were plied with nigh-irresistible desserts: cheesecake, chocolate tortes, profiteroles, beignets—you name it. It was difficult for all of us, but especially for poor Dan, who was forever at the mercy of his sweet tooth.</p>
<p>It was daily dilemma for my friend. Dan, who was an economist with high cholesterol, wanted dessert. But he also understood that eating dessert every day was not a good decision. He contemplated this problem (along with his other academic interests), and concluded that when faced with temptation, a wise person should occasionally succumb. After all, by doing so, said person can keep him- or herself from becoming overly depleted, which will provide strength for whatever unexpected temptations lie in wait. Dan decided that giving in to daily dessert would be his best defense against being caught unawares by temptation and weakness down the road.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, we’ve all heard time and time again that if you restrict your diet too much, you’ll likely to go overboard and binge at some point. Well, it’s true. A crucial aspect of managing depletion and making good decisions is having ways to release stress and reset, and to plan for certain indulgences. In fact, I think one reason the <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds/">Slow-Carb Diet</a> seems to be so effective is because it advises dieters to take a day off (also called a “cheat” day–see item 4 above), which allows them to avoid becoming so deprived that they give up entirely. The key here is planning the indulgence rather than waiting until you have absolutely nothing left in the tank. It’s in the latter moments of desperation that you throw yourself on the couch with the whole pint of ice cream, not even making a pretense of portion control, and go to town while watching your favorite tv show.</p>
<p>Regardless of the indulgence, whether it’s a new pair of shoes, some “me time” where you turn off your phone, an ice cream sundae, or a night out—plan it ahead. While I don’t recommend daily dessert, this kind of release might help you face down challenges to your will power later.</p>

<p>Brad Feld's post <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2012/08/the-power-of-passion-when-starting-your-company.html">The Power of Passion When Starting Your Compony</a> reminds me of a pivot we made more than two years ago.  <strong>Do what you love is not an idealist slogan or a wishy-washy talk. It's the only thing that carries startup over the long, dark and endless days in the <a href="http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/shirlawsresources/2011/8/25/article-from-paul-grahams-trough-of-sorrow-to-infinity-and-b.html">trough of sorrow</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Here is our story. When <a href="http://timbull.com/">Tim</a> and I started BinaryPlex, we had a clear idea on what to build.   It was called Tribalytic, basically Google Trends for Twitter.  We've manged to sign up quite a few paying customers. We've got a couple of companies interested in acquiring our big data analysis technology. We also lined up one of the biggest Non-for-profit company for a pilot.  In May 2010, Tim and I went to Twitter's first developer conference and even <a href="http://timbull.com/reflections-on-start-up-life-week-215-san-fra">got invited to give a demo at Twitter HQ</a>. Things are looking good from outside.  Except we were running short of money.</p>
<p>Tim and I took on a consulting job for a couple of weeks and by the end of the second week, we had a long skype chat.  I can still remember myself walking on the squeaky wooden floor and tried to explain to Tim that I don't have any passion left for Tribalytic. I don't personally use it and I don't care what happen to it anymore.  I still want to do startup but I just couldn't pull myself together to push Tribalytic any further.  By then, we've already used up our capital reserve, struggle to figure out how to extend our runway and we don't know what we can do to change that situation in a short period.  That was a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>By the end of that call, Tim and I were both very clear that we'd have to put Tribalytic on hold and figure out something else we want to implement.  We want to build something we could use everyday. And that was trunk.ly.  What we eventually got acquired for.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/1613385099_a7e5c4a1d0.jpg"></p>
<p>During the next 12 months building Trunk.ly, there had been 10x more dark moments. We were running even lower on money. Both of us started to rack up debts.  We've got 1M investment term sheet signed but the investor ran out of money.  We had to take on contract works and realized this is only making things slower.</p>
<p>But we never gave up.  Looking back, we could be stubborn or naive. Yet We were <strong><em>definitely</em></strong> passionate about trunk.ly. And <strong>that passion was like a lighthouse to a lonely ship on a foreign ocean. </strong>It gave us hope and strength to keep going. Blindly believe that we will figure one way out.</p>
<p><strong>Don't settle. Build what you love.  </strong></p>

        <p>Located at the bottom of the world, I was quite often asked how do I keep up with the latest development in the world. Well, a large proportion of those come from listening to the following podcasts on my way to work.  They are usually an hour long and provides opinions rather than just the news, which I can get from scanning through twitter, techmeme or hacker news.</p>
<p>So here you go:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a>: Marco and Dan talk about industry news, iOS, Mac and web development. Their comments on latest news like the <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/91">Twitter quadrant</a> reveals a lots of thoughts that's quite fresh and unique. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-venture-capital/">This week in Venture Capital</a>: Mark Suster hosts this show with CEOs, established entrepreneurs, VCs and lawyers.  Different from the show above, the value of this one is less about the conversation itself since these are strictly on-the-record conversation.  I value the judgement call and value system they used to evaluate contemporary events. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://thechangelog.com/">TheChangeLog</a>: a pure programming show. The hosts Adam and Wynn are what you might call "cool kids in the heart of san francisco". So this is where I get to keep an update-to-date view on what the cool kids are doing.  It's Ruby on Rails and node.js heavy but also have good coverage of Erlang and Mac development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/">IT Conversations</a>: This is a network of many podcasts and conferences including Velocity, Web 2.0, OSCON, RailsConf. The content covered here are more high level and quite in-depth.  Different from the "change log" show, this one is less about hard core programming but more on how technology is used in different field. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts/manager-tools">Manager Tools</a>: Where I try to learn managing.  It provides a todo-list of tasks manager is expected to do. What I like about this show is the idea that management is not a challenging task. Rather, it's just repeating the same best practice. Sometime I do find the examples they're using to be a bit more related to traditional industry instead of software development. </p>

I couldn't understand how could this be a good idea at all.  Yesterday I finished class note from Peter Thiel's  Class 18: <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/24578683805/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-18-notes-essay">Founder as Victim and Founder as God</a>, which offers a perfect explanation.</p>
<p>The theory is as simple as this. The founder usually follows an inverted normal distribution where their personalities sit at the extreme ends of the spectrum.</p>

<p>This is the same as the main characters in history and mythology, like Oedipus, Achilles or Cessar.</p>

<p>Human's history is filled of a cycle between peace and chaos. The invention of scapegoat makes that cycle complete.  The cultures that last long all, in one way or another, invented the sacrifice concept.</p>

<p>When time gets rough, the founder, especially the single founder, becomes the easy target and the perfect candidate for a scapegoat.</p>

<p>Peter also talked about whether it's possible to delay or even avoid this process near the end of the article. His suggestions?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Founders should think carefully about how to preserve the original founding moment for as long as possible. The key is to encourage and achieve perpetual innovation. It is very important to avoid, or at least delay, the shift to a horrible bureaucracy where no one can do anything and everyone is circumscribed.</p>
