<p>Most of my respected entrepreneurs are the ones who <a href="http://alexdong.com/fundamentally-unemployable/">dare to be different</a>. Who stands on their own rights and push the boundaries. Like the <a href="https://medium.com/20/93b9168703d6">giant tree. </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A carpenter and his apprentices were travelling through the province of Qi in search of building materials.
They saw a giant tree; five men all holding hands could not encompass its girth, and its crown reached almost to the clouds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Let’s not waste our time with this tree,’ said the master carpenter. ‘It would take us for ever to cut it down. If we wanted to make a ship out of that heavy trunk, the ship would sink. If we tried to use it to build a roof, the walls would have to be specially reinforced.’</p>
<p>The group continued on its way. One of the apprentices remarked:</p>
<p>‘Such a big tree and no use to anyone!’</p>
<p>‘That’s where you’re wrong,’ said the master carpenter. ‘The tree was true to its own destiny.
“If it had been like all the others, we would have cut it down. But because it had the courage to be different, it will remain alive and strong for a long time yet.</p>

<p>The more I learn about Israel and its culture, the more I like it.</p>
<p>One concrete example is this kind of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ilan-abehassera">optimism</a> after a total unfair treatment from a company whose motto is "Don't be Evil".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the interesting part. On my last day at Zlio, I had a long discussion with Jeremie, and despite the bad times, Jeremie was still very optimistic and even relieved I would say. Why? He told me his life’s theory, and it’s based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</a> principle that I’ve been following ever since, and that has changed my life (yes really).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In hebrew we say “<a href="http://www.neveh.org/price/price2.html">Gam Zou Letova</a>”, that could be translated by : “Everything that happens in your life is for your own good”, or, “Every challenge makes you stronger”. You get the idea.</p>
<p>When Jeremie explained it to me, I had a hard time understanding this optimistic principle in such hard times in his professional life. All he said was, don’t worry, good things will happen after this tough experience.</p>
<p>This is the story about the screw-over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the little story, Zlio, became blacklisted/sandboxed by Google 6 months after…. It killed the company…</p>

<p>Besides, the core problem in local is not a technology problem: It’s the reluctance of many small businesses to use Internet technologies. That’s a problem hundreds (if not thousands) of companies have wrestled with for 15 years now. Many companies have built self-serve platforms that few businesses used. Groupon’s innovation was to strip away the requirement for the business to use a computer, make Internet advertising less targeted, less efficient and more expensive — expensive enough that it could afford to pay a sales force.</p>

<p>There is another definition of success: sustained pride in the quality of our work.</p>
<p>If, in our creative endeavors, we continually do work we are proud of, then that my friends is also success. We don’t make to get rich, we make to make. We build for the sake of building, create for the sake of creating.</p>

<p>Fred Wilson just posted an interesting paper on startup business models for Bitcoin Bank.  I bolded 3 fundamental questions that each startup should try to answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you are finalising your Business Model Canvas for your final project for this course, think about <strong>what your key value proposition is and who is your primary customer</strong> and focus on that. And think about what you can do in your <strong>revenue model to make it</strong> so that it will be h<strong>ard for others to come in and undercut you</strong>. And think about your <strong>cost model and how to keep it as low as possible while allowing your company to be best in class</strong> at what it does.</p>

        <h2>- culture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In advancing through modernity toward a digital, networked world, <strong>we have gained connectivity at the expense of continuity.</strong> Analog technology embodied continuity, and the very fabric of society was more continuous and whole before a variety of innovations enabled us to slice, separate, and otherwise reorganize our reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>People who grow up in the Holey Plane tend to relate to their environments differently than their traditional urban predecessors. ... With a car, an iPhone, and a credit card, one can be right at home throughout much of a metropolis like Houston. ... The explosion of social media and smartphone apps epitomizes this shift, transforming countless aspects of city life, such as restaurant recommendations and dating, into more rationalized, algorithm-driven processes. After all, many of us <strong>have lived hyperconnected lives that are broken up by jump cuts</strong> across space and time, and we welcome any tool that can smooth our experience of a discontinuous world. Despite what he says, <strong>Mark Zuckerberg isn’t connecting that world—he’s just covering up the holes.</strong></p>
