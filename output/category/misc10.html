<p>Besides, the core problem in local is not a technology problem: It’s the reluctance of many small businesses to use Internet technologies. That’s a problem hundreds (if not thousands) of companies have wrestled with for 15 years now. Many companies have built self-serve platforms that few businesses used. Groupon’s innovation was to strip away the requirement for the business to use a computer, make Internet advertising less targeted, less efficient and more expensive — expensive enough that it could afford to pay a sales force.</p>

<p>Fred Wilson just posted an interesting paper on startup business models for Bitcoin Bank.  I bolded 3 fundamental questions that each startup should try to answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you are finalising your Business Model Canvas for your final project for this course, think about <strong>what your key value proposition is and who is your primary customer</strong> and focus on that. And think about what you can do in your <strong>revenue model to make it</strong> so that it will be h<strong>ard for others to come in and undercut you</strong>. And think about your <strong>cost model and how to keep it as low as possible while allowing your company to be best in class</strong> at what it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In advancing through modernity toward a digital, networked world, <strong>we have gained connectivity at the expense of continuity.</strong> Analog technology embodied continuity, and the very fabric of society was more continuous and whole before a variety of innovations enabled us to slice, separate, and otherwise reorganize our reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>People who grow up in the Holey Plane tend to relate to their environments differently than their traditional urban predecessors. ... With a car, an iPhone, and a credit card, one can be right at home throughout much of a metropolis like Houston. ... The explosion of social media and smartphone apps epitomizes this shift, transforming countless aspects of city life, such as restaurant recommendations and dating, into more rationalized, algorithm-driven processes. After all, many of us <strong>have lived hyperconnected lives that are broken up by jump cuts</strong> across space and time, and we welcome any tool that can smooth our experience of a discontinuous world. Despite what he says, <strong>Mark Zuckerberg isn’t connecting that world—he’s just covering up the holes.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote about <a href="http://alexdong.com/learn-a-language-you-wont-use-in-work/">learning a language you won't use in work</a>, mainly because by doing so, you'll gain understanding of the "right way" to do things.  <a href="http://alexdong.com/alan-kay-normal-considered-harmful/">Perspective</a> sometimes worth a lot more than people expected. Celluloid is a Ruby project that seems to get async model right by taking ideas from Erlang and implement them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By combining concurrency with object oriented programming, Celluloid frees you up from worry about where to use threads and locks. Celluloid combines them together into a single concurrent object oriented programming model, encapsulating state in concurrent objects and thus avoiding many of the problems associated with multithreaded programming. Celluloid provides many features which make concurrent programming simple, easy, and fun:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Automatic "deadlock-free" synchronization: Celluloid uses a concurrent object model which combines method dispatch and thread synchronization. Each actor is a concurrent object running in its own thread, and <strong>every method invocation is wrapped in a fiber that can be suspended whenever it calls out to other actors, and resumed when the response is available</strong>. This means methods which are waiting for responses from other actors, external messages, or other system events (including I/O with Celluloid::IO) can be suspended and will never block other methods that are ready to run. This won't prevent bugs in Celluloid, bugs in other thread-safe libraries you use, and even certain "dangerous" features of Celluloid from causing your program to deadlock, but in general, programs built with Celluloid will be naturally immune to deadlocks.</p>
<p>Fault-tolerance: Celluloid has taken to <strong>heart many of Erlang's ideas about fault-tolerance in order to enable self-healing applications</strong>. The central idea: have you tried turning it off and on again? Celluloid takes care of rebooting subcomponents of your application when they crash, whether it's a single actor, or large (potentially multi-tiered) groups of actors that are all interdependent. This means rather that worrying about rescuing every last exception, you can just sit back, relax, and let parts of your program crash, knowing Celluloid will automatically reboot them in a clean state. Celluloid provides its own implementation of the <strong>core fault-tolerance concepts in Erlang including linking, supervisors, and supervision groups.</strong></p>

<p>Resque is a single-thread, single-process, fork-based process. Running lots of them incurs serious swapping. There have been proposals of running <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/09/16/improving-resques-memory-efficiency/">jruby</a> to solve this problem but looks like Sidekq and the upcoming Ruby 3.0 offer a cleaner solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidekiq uses multithreading so it is much more memory efficient than Resque (which forks a new process for every job). You'll find that you might need 50 200MB resque processes to peg your CPU whereas one 300MB Sidekiq process will peg the same CPU and perform the same amount of work. Please see my blog post on Resque's memory efficiency and how I was able to shrink a Carbon Five client's resque processing farm from 9 machines to 1 machine.</p>

<p>The following post from Telsa, the new car making company, reminds me the challenges people used to have when Apple opened its own physical store.  And why the late comers like Samsung are also piloting their own physical store as well.  <strong>People still triumphs machine, branding and technology at the end of day, especially for ground-breaking new stuff</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the time most people decide to head to their local dealer, they have already pretty much decided what car they want to buy, which is usually the same make as their old car. At that point it is largely just a matter of negotiating with the dealer on price. Tesla, as a new carmaker, would therefore rarely have the opportunity to educate potential customers about Model S if we were positioned in typical auto dealer locations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why we are deliberately positioning our store and gallery locations in high foot traffic, high visibility retail venues, like malls and shopping streets that people regularly visit in a relatively open-minded buying mood. This allows us to interact with potential customers and have them learn about our cars from Tesla Product Specialists before they have decided which new car to buy. The Product Specialists are also trained to answer questions about electric vehicles in general, not just ours. They are not on commission and they will never pressure you to buy a car. Their goal and the sole metric of their success is to have you enjoy the experience of visiting so much that you look forward to returning again.</p>
<p>As it is, our Product Specialists could not sell you a car today under any circumstances, as Model S is already sold out several months in advance and there is no inventory on site. All they can do is get you to consider placing a reservation. Our stores are designed to be informative and interactive in a delightful way and are simply unlike the traditional dealership with several hundred cars in inventory that a commissioned salesperson is tasked with selling. Our technology is different, our car is different, and, as a result, our stores are intentionally different.</p>
