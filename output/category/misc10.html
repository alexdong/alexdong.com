<p>Alan Kay's 2009 talk in UIUC on what distinguishes us from frogs,  how to escape the pink normal plane, the power of outlooks, importance of expanding one's horizon, value of understanding the problem first before attacking a really hard problem.</p>
<p>The target audiences are computer science students at UIUC but if you get started from 32:00, you should get right into the solution part if you are not interested in learning what's wrong with today's browser design and how it should be an OS first.</p>
<p>Here are the slides that interest me the most.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inner people is driven by forces from inside and outer people seek approval from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instrumental people think today is the future, they maintain status quo and ideas/tools people focus on the future and believe today can be better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner+Instrumental: dangerous. Some politicians and most dictators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner+Idea: who moves the history forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Da Vinci is born with high IQ but Henry Ford was born in the right century with the knowledge ready for him. Hence Ford revolutionized how we travel yet  Da Vinci couldn't assemble an engine of his own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculus and Newton offered us some powerful tools that teach us how to see the world differently. Now a high school student can do things that aren't even thinkable in Da Vinci's time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outlook is very powerful because it helps us to see the world different. How to increase it? Travel. Think. Don't be instrumental. Think normal as harmful. Believe the world can be better. Escape the pink plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some universal traits anthropologists have found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take any of these traits and amplify them, you've got a killer business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully encourage and go after those "non-universal" ones. These are the things that separate us from frogs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul MacCready was awarded the best engineer of 20th century for building the first human powered airplane that flew from UK to French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previous attempts started with an assumption, built a prototype, crashed it and try another assumption in another 18 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul started by constructing a really simple model, as shown on left-bottom corner, that allows him to cycle through assumptions and ideas within a few minutes. Hence he explored the problem space a lot thoroughly. He won the awards in simply 5 years.</p>

<p>Ran into a few posts about startup traction and the concept of quant based market. Thought it might benefit some readers of this blog. (If you haven't read my previous post of <a href="http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/">distribution channels,</a> you should.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gabriel from DuckDuckGo has two nice articles on this topic.  "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">How to move the needle</a>" talks about traction for different growth period and "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">Traction mistakes</a>" lists 4 common mistakes people make. I have all four of them squarely.  This 50% time on product and 50% for traction parallel thinking is certainly the approach I'd take if I have a chance to do it again.   BTW, he is writing a <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">book</a> on this topic too. His co-author has a <a href="http://justinmares.com/thoughts-on-paul-grahams-growth/">recent review </a>on PG's "Startup = Growth" essay which echos what Gabriel has said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noah Kagan who did the original marketing work for mint.com has an interesting post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2010/07/15/quant-based-marketing-for-pre-launch-start-ups/">Quant Based Marketing</a>.  The basic idea is pretty simple. List all potential channels of incoming attention and conversion rate from day-0. Then follow through the list.  Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuTYwDzB4XSudGpFcE9lSWI4YzUwcnhKZnNoMktEdkE&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0">spreadsheet </a>for it.

<p>A couple of days ago, I blogged about the<a href="http://alexdong.com/union-square-ventures-investment-thesis-explained/"> investment philosophy of USV</a> from NYC.   Here is a similar piece from the Colorado based Foundry Group.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2008/03/what-is-thematic-investing/">This article explains</a> 2 things: "what types of companies do you guys like to invest in? and what sectors do you find interesting?”Here is a quick excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our themes tend to be horizontal in nature and are often based on an underlying protocol, standard or market trend that we believe is on the cusp of widespread adoption that has the potential to drive a cycle of innovation and company creation for at least a five to ten year period. We try to focus on themes and their underlying technologies that are ready to be rolled out to consumers or the enterprise and are well beyond the science-experiment phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make this concrete, some examples of themes we are excited about presently and historically include email, RSS, the implicit web and human-computer interaction (HCI). Because themes are inherently horizontal, they have often have applications in the consumer and enterprise markets and can be delivered in myriad ways, whether it is via a web site, SaaS, a gadget, an appliance or good old-fashioned downloadable client or server software.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/themes/">detailed list of portfolio companies across 6 themes</a>.</p>

<p>There are two stereotyped perspective of investing. One assumes that every year, there are about 10 investment opportunities for the whole industry.  So the investor's main job is to locate those deals and be part of it.  The other insists that there are certain rules on how startup works. So they try to find/curate startups following those lines. These two views map quite nicely into Peter Thiel's <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/23787022006/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-14-notes-essay">2x2 matrix of determinate/indeterminate and optimistic/pessimistic of future</a>.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I'm firmly in the determinate/optimistic area but well aware that unknown and luck is still a major part of the game.  Without any control over the luck factor, the best startups can do is to figure out the "right model" and structure your company accordingly.</p>
<p>I have been looking for a concise, yet comprehensive, explanation of the key components for a successful start-up.  Yesterday, I finally stumble upon one.  Print this one out. Use it as a compass for your business.</p>

        <p>The clothesline paradox tells a lot about the value flow.  I believe the current way of measuring economic using GDP somewhat encourages the endless and blind churn to keep the growth. Not saying the growth is bad, it is not. But more along the line where we want to think carefully about whether we are really creating value or we are just keep running like a blinded mule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about a piece I read in Stuart Brand's, CoEvolution Quarterly back in 1975. It's called the "Clothesline Paradox." The author, Steve Baer, was talking about alternative energy. The thesis is simple: <strong>You put your clothes in the dryer, and the energy you use gets measured and counted. You hang your clothes on the clothesline, and it "disappears" from the economy.</strong> It struck me that there are a lot of things that we're dealing with on the Internet that are subject to the Clothesline Paradox. Value is created, but it's not measured and counted. It's captured somewhere else in the economy.</p>

<p>It took him a few years to get going on that, but once he started, there was no turning back.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are a little crazy. That’s a good thing. Some of us can’t do anything else, and can’t take a normal job- and <strong>if we did try to take one, no matter how good of a situation it is, we’d blow it up</strong>. I think having an experience like the one that Noah had at Facebook teaches a lot of different things- not just who we are, but also who we’re not. It’s lucky, in my opinion, that he had such a pivotal experience so early in his career. It means that he’s free, for the rest of his life, to pursue who he really wants to be. Everyone should share that kind of experience</p>

<p>It's not often for me to become interested in technology itself these days. But the discussion between git pull and git rebase has interested me a lot.  Not for its own technology details but more as a tool to either loose or strengthen an engineering culture.</p>
<p>git pull encourages a rather loose, relax and, in the long run, ad-hoc manner of team work.  This suits startup cultures quite well.   It's fast to learn and easy for people who migrate from older version controls like subversions to learn.  Engineers works on his own little branch. He has no reason to integrate with other people's code until the very end of one's little project is finished.  The commit history ends up having messages that describes more about the code and less about the reason and thinking behind this list of patches.  For example, if you happen to follow the resque project, you'll realize that <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque/commit/832fb9d696c4367ae17d99aaa2ef6b43268605c5">a commit message like this</a> is not really that helpful. 7 lines of changes.  One line comment without explaining why the 'destroy' is delayed.</p>
<p>git rebase encourages comparatively stricter engineering culture. One has to pay attention to not only his code, but also the commit histories.  Projects like linux kernel uses it to enforce a culture of <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html"> keep clean history</a>. Linus even wrote up what a good commit would look like <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface/blob/master/README#L161">here. </a>  I can see how this could be very helpful in a project where the code needs to be maintained 15 years later by totally different set of people.  A clean history, instead of a loose list of incremental functional changes, will provide more context in the long run.  As a sample,<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766"> check out this patch</a> by Linus for a firmware related patch. <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blobdiff;f=drivers/base/firmware_class.c;h=81541452887bd3ce5d868909e3fb753fb3d6b124;hp=e85763de928f096e46cbfd74abb69c064e5c2101;hb=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766;hpb=e1cc485262846dcad931bf85ee655cbbb815bfe6">4 lines</a> of changes, 8 lines of comments on the commit.</p>
