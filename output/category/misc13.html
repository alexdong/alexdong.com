        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>So you've decided to start your own business. If you are like many other first-time entrepreneurs, you want to build the next Google.  Or the next Apple.  You want to walk into a coffee shop and see everyone is using your product.  You might even want to "make a dent in the universe".  There is nothing wrong about this.  This is usually the most long-lasting motivation for entrepreneurs when things go bad and one has to continue fighting.  <strong>However, if you start out wanting to do nothing less than taking on the whole world, chances are you will be disappointed.  There is no direct path to "change the world". </strong></p>
<p>In this article, you will find a 3-step approach to build a startup. It might be quite different from the "go big or go home" stories you've heard or read. It might seem too humble and not exciting enough, but it's much easier for start a company this way.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: reach "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">Ramen Profitable</a>".</strong>  Paul Graham defines it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses. This is a different form of profitability than startups have traditionally aimed for. Traditional profitability means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it buys you time."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It basically means your company is producing something people want and you are paid enough to make a living off that. It's not the final destination yet but this is a crucial step.  Once you reach this milestone, you suddenly become indestructible.  It doesn't mean you have a perfect product yet. But at least you have an infinite run way to fine tune your offering or try a different plan.</p>
<p>If you get to Ramen profitable, you should celebrate this by adding an extra egg to your Ramen! This might be a tiny step if you compare yourself to a company like IBM or Microsoft.  You may be surprised that you're already better than 90% of all startups,  which close shops in the first year of operation. You have chosen a market, manage to get enough funding to build the idea into a real product and have people found it useful enough to pay for it. (If the people who is paying doesn't even know you, go get another egg for your Ramen please. )</p>
<p>Achieving Ramen profitable does not mean you should stick with the same idea.  Many companies pivoted into a new direction which eventually make their name there.  Take Microsoft as an example. It was founded in 1975 to sell a special version of Basic interpreter called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC">Altair Basic</a>.  But Bill Gates didn't stop there. 5 years later, Microsoft moved into the operation system market and released DOS and then Windows, two core products that helped to grow itself into a billion dollar company.  The essence here is as you reached this stage, you will have a better understanding of the market. You will be in a much better position to take on new opportunities when it emerges.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: own a niche</strong>.  Become the number one in a market.  It's more important to be the number one in a small market than a number two in a bigger one.  We are living in a "big is better" world so this might sound crazy.  Who haven't read about Facebook's IPO and secretly wish he could be one of those 1,000 fresh minted millionaires. However, it may surprise you that usually a smaller market is actually a lot easier to conquer.  Dave McClure has an excellent short article talks about "<a href="http://500hats.com/niche-to-win">niche to win</a>" strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most startups think they have to be <strong>AWESOME</strong> to succeed.  Actually, this is quite far from the truth – in fact, you can be <em>incredibly mediocre</em> and still be quite successful. The secret is to find your <strong>Niche</strong> – that is, the initial customer segmentation / product differentiation combo that enables you to beat your more established, mature competition with a much crappier product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the segmentation and differentiation, you need to own a niche market to get the time and resources to build a team, to hone your marketing messages, to establish your <a href="http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/">distribution channels</a> and turn your technology into a product. Your technology might work for a small group of early adopters who are willing to play with latest tech, but the main stream market requires much refined off-the-shelf product.</p>
<p>There is a gap between the early adopters and the rest of the market. A premature expansion usually sinks the company by burning too fast too early.  When it really should carefully fine tune its offering and use its resources frugally. This idea is best explained by "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0066620023">Crossing the Chasm</a>",  one of the best book on marketing and selling high tech product to mainstream market.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: bowling into adjacent markets.</strong>  Geoffrey A. Moore, the author who wrote the Chasm book, explains the next step in his other book called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Tornado-Strategies-Developing-Hypergrowth/dp/0060745819">Inside Tornado</a>". The basic idea is once you dominate one niche, the next thing is to expand into adjacent markets. Just like playing bowling, you don't try to knock down all the pins at once. Instead, you hit the first one at the right angel, then let the ball as well as the first pin to take down the 2nd and the 3rd; then all these pins will help to spread the force and take the rests.</p>

<p>Yup. I mean it. If you have two functions on your website and your fellow co-worker asked you "which one shall I use to do task X" and you have to explain to them "A is for this and B is similar but it does this.". It's time to kill one feature. It's just that simple. It's also one design principle you can hear me constantly speaking in work.</p>
<p>Design, by its nature, is like editing an article. If you have two paragraphs saying pretty much the same thing, will you keep both of them. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of square and Chairman of Twitter basically said "<a href="https://twitter.com/hash/status/84417208385683456">CEO is the Editor of the product, the team and the story</a>".</p>

<p>Today's NYTimes has an interesting article on magazine. It argues from a different perspective. Instead of the typical argue of value of creation vs. curation, it tells a story of the media itself. Here is the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, it doesn’t matter what you put on the cover of your magazine if no one will look at you. A few weeks ago, I was in a busy doctor’s office with a dozen others, absently paging through the magazines on the table. The table in front of us was stacked with the pride of American publishing, all manner of topics and fancy covers yelling for attention. Ever the intrepid media reporter, I looked up from scanning Bon Appétit to see what other people were interested in. A mother and a daughter were locked in conversation, but <strong>everyone else was busy reading — their phones</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coincidentally, the recent data from the major internet service providers are on a very strong uprising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook: 102 million people accessed Facebook solely from mobile<strong> in June, a massive 23% increase over the 83 million mobile-only users in March</strong>.<strong> 18.7% of its 543 million monthly mobile users don’t even visit its desktop site.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>eBay's mobile shoppers and <strong>mobile payers are 3 to 4 times more valuable than Web</strong> only. Mobile was a major contributor to eBay's Q2 growth with 600,000 new customers making their first purchase through eBay’s mobile apps.</p>
<p>Yelp. 10% of Yelp's monthly uniques access the service on mobile but account for <strong>a disproportionate 40% of Yelp's search query volume.</strong></p>
<p>If your startup or company or product does not have a mobile aspect to it, I'd be worried.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Every once for a while, there will be some ground-breaking articles that come along. They would either redefine something I thought I've understood quite well, like <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/">Magic Ink: Information Software and Graphical Interface</a>, or make something I always fail to grasp crystal clear like Paul Graham's <a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">How to Make Wealth</a>.  Recently, I have been reading <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup/">Peter Thiel's talks at Stanford's CS183 course</a>.  None of the above are easy-reads but they definitely worth read several times to understand thoroughly the points.</p>
<p>First, he talks about the engineer bias that leads many, including myself, to underestimate the importance of distribute your product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But for whatever reason, people do not get distribution. They tend to overlook it. It is the single topic whose importance people understand least. Even if you have an incredibly fantastic product, you still have to get it out to people. The engineering bias blinds people to this simple fact. The conventional thinking is that great products sell themselves; if you have great product, it will inevitably reach consumers. But nothing is further from the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then went on to explain why most people thinks salesman are dishonesty and hence forgot we forgot president, investors, entrepreneurs are all salesman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are culturally biased to think of salespeople as classically untrustworthy, and unreliable. The used car dealer is the archetypical example. Marc Andreessen has noted that <strong>most engineers underestimate the sales side of things because they are very truth-oriented people.</strong> In engineering, something either works or it doesn’t. The surface appearance is irrelevant. So engineers tend to view attempts to change surface appearance of things—that is, sales—as fundamentally dishonest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is tricky about sales is that</strong>, while we know that it exists all around us,<strong> it’s not always obvious who the real salesperson is</strong>. Tom Sawyer convinced all the kids on the block to whitewash the fence for him. None of those neighborhood kids recognized the sale. The game hasn’t changed. And that’s why that story rings true today.</p>
<p>Sales work looks like easy, just like everyone thought politician is easy. But in fact, there might be similar huge gap between a master and a mediocre player.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good analogy to the engineer vs. sales dynamic is experts vs. politicians. If you work at a big company, you have two choices. You can become expert in something, like, say, international tax accounting. It’s specialized and really hard. It’s also transparent in that it’s clear whether you’re actually an expert or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other choice is to be a politician. These people get ahead by being nice to others and getting everyone to like them. Both expert and politician can be successful trajectories. But <strong>what tends to happen is that people choose to become politicians rather than experts because it seems easier. Politicians _seem _like average people, so average people simply assume that they can do the same thing.</strong></p>
<p>The next highlight comes when he describes the importance of crack the nut of finding the most important factor in all the distribution channel under the sun and win it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is a really bad idea. It is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. <strong>Poor distribution—not product—is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have great business.</strong> If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. So it’s worth thinking really hard about finding the single best distribution channel. If you are an enterprise software company with a sales team, your key strategic question is: who are the people who are most likely to buy the product? That will help you close in on a good channel. What you want to avoid is not thinking hard about which customers are going to buy it and just sending your sales team out to talk to everybody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also covers PR/Marketing, enterprise sales and a bit history of advertisement. But from an engineer-turned-entrepreneur perspective, the above are the ones that really nail it for me. Hope you enjoy it as well.</p>

<p>I finished Clay Christensen's new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Will-Measure-Your-Life/dp/0062102419/">How will you measure your life</a> this week.  Yes, the same Clay who wrote the ground breaking book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Essentials/dp/0060521996">Innovator's Dilemma</a>" which defines what is a "disruptive innovation" and why well established companies often failed to compete with new emergent companies who was offering much cheaper and inferior products. If you haven't read that book yet, go buying one now and do yourself a favor by reading it cover to cover. It is literally the <em>bible</em> in startup worlds.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://harpercollins.co.in/Book_CoverImage/3306_Full_how_will_you_measure_your_life.jpg">Ok, back to the new book.  I was a bit surprised to find that he wrote a new book talking about life and family. "The soft stuff."  But I have to admit that I was secretly happy to see that.  You see, about 4 weeks ago, I caught some flu and became seriously sick. I spent almost a whole week on bed.  The body just gave up under me.  Even reading was too much work.  Since then, I've been in the process of recovering for a month.  I quite often feel tired.</p>
<p>I've been working 80-hour-a-week for quite a while. This one-week-in-bed experience made me start wondering how long I can keep up with this lifestyle. How long I should wait before I start paying more attention to other parts of my life.  This book comes at the perfect time. It asked the right questions and forced me to think through some major life decisions I haven't made for myself.</p>
<p>Here is his 20-minutes talk at TEDxBoston. It provides a good overview of the questions he covered in the book.  Notice the crane, yes, he was brought down after his cancer and lost part of his ability to write and express himself.</p>
<p><strong>When I was asked "<a href="https://twitter.com/diamondtin/status/233053668189020161">will you give this book a 5-star</a>", I'd answer a firm yes.</strong> And I'm pretty sure that it'll become one of the very few books that I will read again in a couple of years.  However I am not sure this book is for everyone.  It seems like it wouldn't be of much interest to the Alex a few months ago anyway. This is <strong>a great book for people who have already </strong><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3225-what-are-questions"><strong>got the question in their mind</strong> for a while</a>.  Here is some really eye-opening way of looking at the importance of questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve probably heard it said that someone can’t be taught until they’re ready to learn. I’ve heard it said that way too. It makes sense, and my experience tells me it’s mostly true. Why though? Why can’t someone be taught until they’re ready to learn?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clay explained it in a way that I’ve never heard before and I’ll never forget again. Paraphrased slightly, he said: <strong>“Questions are places in your mind where answers fit.</strong> If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question – you have to want to know – in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.”</p>
<p>What an insight. He continued to talk about the power of questions. Questions are your mind’s receptors for answers. <strong>If you aren’t curious enough to want to know why, to want to ask questions, then you’re not making the room in your mind for answers. If you stop asking questions, your mind can’t grow.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/26376/Mobile-Apps-Models-Money-and-Loyalty">User loyalty and retention rate per category</a>. I is the best area to be since users there use the app more often and tend to stick around longer; III sucks as a category.  This provides a very useful way to "benchmark" your app to other similar apps and answer the question: is my average monthly user rate too low or it's just normal.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog.flurry.com/Portals/41620/images//Loyalty_by_AppCategory_updated.png"></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/88014/The-Great-Distribution-of-Wealth-Across-iOS-and-Android-Apps">Majority of the mobile app revenue comes from premium and in-app-purchase</a>.  Clearly advertising revenue makes up small percentage of the revenue. Although it's the "fastest growing revenue category".  You can also see that the size of the app market grows 80% from 5B to an estimated 9B.</p>

        <h2>- design</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/about.mefi">Matt Haughey's talk on MetaFilter</a>, he has one slide that says "<em>Beautiful visual design doesn't always win</em>".   The story was that he paid someone to "redesign" the site. When the design is ready, he ran a test to send 50% anonymous user to the new design and 50% to the original site. It turned out that <strong>the old, "ugly" site outperformed the new design by 30%</strong>. (Fast forward to 9:30 if you're in a hurry.  I strongly recommend the whole video, it's not only entertaining but also provides quite different thinking into building a community site.)</p>
<p>In the age of iPhone and maybe a bit overuse of the word "beautiful", this kind of thinking sounds like heresy. But if you take a look at the popular community sites like HackerNews, SlashDot or Craigslist, you'll find that they are all not-so-pretty.  I'm sure they are not short of resources to get a "better" design but they choose not to, why is that? I come up with 3 explanations.  Please leave a comment to share your thoughts.</p>
<p>First, the more beautiful a site is, the less relaxed the user will be.  Hence less likely to participate. Community site is optimized around the goal of having people to hang around and talk to each other. Kind of like a party. Imagine you're invited to a party where there are a few Claude Monet paintings on the wall.  The ground is soft. The lights are adjusted to highlight the paintings. Will you spend more time chatting or will you feel guilty if your chit-chat breaks the mood that the paintings have created?  I suspect the same human feeling applies to online communities. If you want the users to feel relaxed and casual, you might have to make the site less logical, with less visual hierarchy.</p>
<p>Second, a distinguishable site makes it much easier to form a sense of belongingness. Or a sense of being part of something unique.   Seth Godin has a whole book to say about tribes. But the basic idea is <em>human beings can't help it: we need to belong. One of the most powerful of our survival mechanisms is to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of like-minded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging</em>.  Those distinguishable sites define their own social rules. And these rules are translated into look-and-feels by the creators. So from this perspective, the HackerNews orange or the reddit moscot is similar to the feathers to American Indians.</p>
<p>Last but not least, these community sites are actually very functional.  Prioritizing visual design over functional or interaction design is a common trap that many designers fall into. Community site is all about the contents and discussions. These site designs serve this goal very well.  I have yet seen anyone who comes to reddit or HackerNews and couldn't figure out what to do next. Yes, comment threads can be long but it is almost stupidly easy to add one. And that is what truly drives traffic and bump average time-on-site.</p>
<p>Having said this, I think an utility like Facebook, iPhone or Mail.app should adopt a more streamline and strong visual language.  When people derive values by performing certain tasks, a stronger visual design would help to guide, or force, the user to go down certain pre-defined path/funnel.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>On July. 26th, 2012, NYTimes announced that it's now "<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/07/new-york-times-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers.html">supported by readers, not advertisers</a>". This is a <strong>watershed moment in the history of internet</strong>.  As digital content becomes more and more native in our daily life, people are willing to pay for good contents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the company's big three papers — the <em>Times</em>, <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, and Boston_ Globe_ — print and digital ad dollars dipped 6.6 percent to $220 million, while circulation revenue was up 8.3 percent to $233 million. <strong>The historical rebalancing</strong>, which occurred at the News Media Group for the first time in Q1, <strong>may indicate a sea change in an industry that has long relied on advertising to stay afloat</strong>. "They're probably the first major paper that has crossed that line," media analyst Ken Doctor of <em>Newsonomics</em> told Daily Intel. "It is an interesting moment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost at the same time, quite a few major internet brands suffer from non-trivial market value evaporation. As written in <a href="http://www.dailydealmedia.com/789facebook-groupon-pandora-and-zynga-have-drained-almost-50-billion-from-investors/">Facebook, Groupon, Pandora and Zynga have Drained Almost $50 Billion from Investors</a>, the author wrote the following about Facebook's performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soaring from a ridiculously inflated IPO price of $38 tagging $45 before reality set in. After a fantastic earnings report (sarcasm here) shares are trading today at $23.49 down only $ .22 on the day (.91%). That, my friend, is a loss of $34.4 billion in market capitalization or 38.2%. Tally so far – $ 34.4 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am amused by this stark comparison.  I still believe that Facebook is creating good amount of value, but whether that justifies such a high stock price is probably a different story.  I found the following analysis echoing with my past experience.  It basic posts a good question: <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/3024">what if social networks value diminishes as the platform starts to monetize it? </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every community-based site in the history of the web has essentially been a stab at creating a social network. Most of them fail as businesses, with the rare exception of small, lucky communities that become self-sufficient but not exactly prosperous. What if that’s just the way it is?</p>

<p>If you prefer tables, numbers and a little bit fundamental analysis, this article has laid the most solid, and technical, analysis of the "<a href="http://www.econmatters.com/2012/05/whats-fair-value-for-facebook-stock.html">real value of facebook</a>".   Based on the size of the advertisement market is "2.1% to 2.3% of nominal GDP" and the numbers disclosed by facebook, the author puts out the following table on projections in 2016.  We'll see.</p>

        <h2>- design</h2>
<p>The new basecamp has a very <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3170-new-in-the-all-new-basecamp-email-in">nicely designed instructions</a> for adding discussions and todo lists via email.  For anyone who has tried to design a feature like this, it's always a challenge to describe the multiple steps and make it easy to remember.  There are two things from this design that really stand out.</p>
<p>First is It describes the action items in a clear numbered-list. Use links and bolded fonts to highlight the important points. <img alt="" src="http://37assets.s3.amazonaws.com/svn/bcxemailin/todolist.png"></p>
<p>The second is the "conceptual" preview of how an email will be converted into a todo list.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Many people in the valley would say "Startup is for opportunists". <a href="http://influencehacks.com/the-value-of-short-term-thinking">This one</a> explains why. Please read this one with a grain of salt since I think the scope for this one is mainly for technology startups that are built to take advantage of a new enabling technology. But still, it's good to see the point from the other side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In technology, long term thinking is impossible, because everything changes so fast, and the pace of change is quickening. The rules are changing too fast. Nobody knows when a sudden shift in technology will open up new markets and business models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All we can do as entrepreneurs is take it step by step, and adapt quickly when we sense the market shifting.</p>
<p>To set the scope a bit, I do think the team, the industry and the understanding of the target market shouldn't change over time.  The knowledge of why people pay for the service should stay the same.  The connections wouldn't change that much.</p>
