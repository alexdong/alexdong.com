<p>I made on average $2,100 a month. My stats were 50,000 uniques and 150,000 page views a month with 8,200 subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After paywall and the $40/year membership fee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how many members do I have? Roughly 255 right now. Again, I don’t know if that is good or horrible. It amounts to a little less than $1,000 a month after fees and such. So less than half of what I was making before.  </p>

<p>Will he keeps on having the paywall? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that the member base is very stable. That I barely gain new members each month, and likely if I want to up the membership I will need to talk about the membership more. Since putting up the paywall I’ve been able to stop caring about stats and money. All I focus on is writing and that’s way better. Yes there is a little bit of support, but far less than the work it took to fill RSS slots, or mentally think about keeping up page views to try and get better ad rates.</p>

Frequency trails use height to show the frequency of data rather than color, and provide higher resolution for outliers. Subtle details can be more easily seen by small variations in height, rather than small variations in color saturation.</em></p>

It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified. It assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them. Their authority is not self-justifying. They have to give a reason for it, a justification. And if they can't justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just. ... Well what's called libertarian in the United States, which is a special U. S. phenomenon, it doesn't really exist anywhere else -- a little bit in England -- permits a very high level of authority and domination but in the hands of private power: so private power should be unleashed to do whatever it likes.</em></p>

JavaScript should win; Dart is bad! But then I came to realize the Dart guys aren’t just setting out to improve the authoring and scalability of web application development. They also really want the web to win. Now I’ve recently spoke about how The Mobile Web Is In Trouble, and clarified that my priorities are seeing it provide a fantastic user experience to everyone. For me, seeing the mobile web be successful trumps language wars and certainly quibbling over syntax. So I’m happy to see developers embrace the authoring advantages of Coffeescript, the smart subset of JavaScript strict mode, the legendary Emscripten &amp; asm.js combo, the compiler feedback of TypeScript and the performance ambitions of Dart.

In the longer term, we all need to work to reduce the power imbalance. Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which lords had responsibilities as well as rights.

<p>Like <a href="http://alexdong.com/ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/">I said</a>, I feel let down by the iOS 7 design.  It is not that Apple won't be able to get the contrasts right or they can't nail the design details. It is not that this does not open up a whole new trend of design that focuses on content, which I agree is a good thing. It is about what is Apple. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/">Designed by Apple</a> is fine. I love Apple's product because they are beautiful and such a joy to use. But down in my heart, <strong>I see Apple as a technology company, not a design company</strong>.  Macintosh made it possible for normal people to run VisiCalc at home.  iPhone offered GPS and high-def camera which enabled a whole range of innovations/industries. These are the things I am looking for on a technology platform provider. </p>
<p>The following comment from HackerNews summarized my thoughts perfectly. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yay change for change's sake.</p>
<p>This is exactly the wrong attitude in my opinion. How does it help users to all of a sudden have most apps feel ancient? Is it really something to be proud of? That for the next year we'll be working on replacing existing utilities so that they feel "right" and "fresh" instead of doing what we should be doing: thinking of actual new software that is worthwhile to write.</p>
<p>I've been saying this for a while but I think what is happening, and what many developers haven't noticed yet, is that we have exhausted the utility of software for software's sake. The interesting stuff happening in mobile now has nothing to do with "design" in the traditional sense any more. Its not enough to just have a coder and a designer on the team. The really cool stuff is all about what your phone actually allows you to do in the real world. Look at apps like uber, postmates, spotify, and twitch.tv. Most of these have terrible UI's, but that's not the point. The point is that they allow you to do things. I can have a car on my doorstep! I can listen to almost any song I want. They're not just another calculator app or news reader, so who cares if its not the prettiest or easiest thing to use in the world. They are an interface to actually useful services. Software was interesting on its own a decade ago, but the industry has grown up, its time to do things now. That doesn't mean that "UI and UX" don't matter, it just means their definition changes and grows beyond just how you tap things on glass and what pixels you choose to animate.</p>
<p>The reason that iOS 7 seems comforting in the way its described in this article is because it gives developers who haven't realized this something to do again. Marco is absolutely right, for a long time it has felt like all the major categories have been covered on the app store. That's a good thing! It means we've solved lots of problems. We shouldn't daydream of a day when those problems get artificially unsolved so we can have another shot at them. We should move on.</p>

<p>Ray Ozzie on why NSA's PRISM program makes now the critical moment for the internet industry for next 10 years.  (Via: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5847189">HackerNews</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back to the present - it pains me to see such a lack of transparency in how our elected officials are running our government. Of course, the common man knows it's common sense that there's an inherent need for secrecy in conducting small scale covert operations. We do get it.
However, it's also common sense that it's inevitable that any complex large-scale long-term operation will ultimately come to light. And so it's just common sense that any such broad-based operations that might be perceived as impacting our constitutional rights should be the subject of broad public debate. No, not when they're being prototyped or tested or used in small scale settings - but definitely somewhere on the path from "tactical use" to "broad strategic dependence".</p>
<p>These are not small issues, nor need they be at all partisan. Wyden, Paul, and others are trying. Theses issues are fundamental to defining the relationship between us citizens and our government in the decades ahead.
In particular, in this world where "SaaS" and "software eats everything" and "cloud computing" and "big data" are inevitable and already pervasive, it pains me to see how 3rd Party Doctrine may now already be being leveraged to effectively gut the intent of U.S. citizens' Fourth Amendment rights. Don't we need a common-sense refresh to the wording of our laws and potentially our constitution as it pertains to how we now rely upon 3rd parties? It makes zero sense in a "services age" where granting third parties limited rights to our private information is so basic and fundamental to how we think, work, conduct and enjoy life.
For example, did you really intend to yield your 4th amendment rights when you granted a 3rd party access to your files as a part of Mac Software Update, Windows Update, Virus Scanners, etc., or when you started using a service-tethered smartphone?</p>
<p>Anyway, unlike 'web tracking' issues which seem to be broadly ignored because of our love for ad-supported services, I hope we all (especially the young readers of reddit, hackernews, etc) wake up to the fact that these privacy and transparency issues are REAL, and that they truly will impact you and the country you live in, and that even if you don't consider yourself an activist you really should get informed and form an opinion. Again, this is a non-partisan issue, and let's all work to ensure that it stays this way.</p>
<p>Two great organizations where you can learn are EPIC and EFF. (Disclosure: I am on the board of EPIC.) Take it in, and think. Your contributions are needed and would of course be quite welcome.</p>

        <h2>- design</h2>
<p>(If you are looking for polarized rants as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>, this  is not for you.)</p>
<p>I love Apple. Before Apple, design was a luxury item that quite often was left to the last stage of product development. After Apple, it has become a top priority.  As an engineer with 15 years training in calligraphy, I feel grateful that Apple has lifted the public's taste for good design.  I don't think I am an Apple fanboy. I am just someone who gets a bit too easily annoyed by bad designs. </p>
<p>Having said that, I have to say <strong>I am a bit let down by the new iOS 7<sup id="fnref:ContextOfDiscussion"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContextOfDiscussion" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></strong>.  Yes, it is a totally new direction for iOS. Apple needs a few iterations to consolidate and refine the design language. Yes, each product needs time to catch up with the new direction. And yes, it takes efforts and compromises to provide a smooth migration path between the old and the new.  There are many reasons I can use to justify why Apple released these products at the current stage. However deep in my heart  <strong>I worry that I might lose yet another company I love and respect <sup id="fnref:CompaniesIRespect"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CompaniesIRespect" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></strong>.</p>
<p>To get started, there are some very well designed apps. Like Clock, Weather<sup id="fnref:ContrastOfWeather"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContrastOfWeather" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and Compass. These designs have nothing loose or left unsettled.  Whitespace ample and balanced. Functions laid out clearly. No surprise. No guess work. Everything is where they should be. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"><img alt="Well designed apps" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"></a></p>
<p>Do keep in mind though that there are little design-tech-feature tensions here though. The feature sets of these apps are well defined so it's mainly a design exercise. So these are the easy ones. </p>
<p>Once we get over simple ones, I start to see inconsistent metaphors.  For example, here are 3 apps all offering the ability to select media from a library. I am particularly perplexed by the newsstand app. On one hand, its "store" sits on the bottom "frosted glass" toolbar, which is kind of new metaphor. On the other hand, it seems to carry with it the old skeuomorphism of a physical magazine stand. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"><img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is another example. There are 2 ways to select from a range of screens. The left is the new "look-down" view on a list of open tabs in Safari. Flip up-and-down to navigation, click the small x on top right corner to delete. The right one is the new screen manager. Flip left-to-right to navigate, swipe to the top to close one.  I'm not sure why Apple releases two totally new yet visually so different ways for the same task. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"><img alt="Tab selection metaphor" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"></a></p>
<p>Besides the inconsistent metaphors, I have to admit that I feel the new "simplified" interface maybe have gone a bit too far in some apps. </p>
<p>The logos feel a bit "too simple". They <strong>feel like the Apple logo without the bite</strong>.  The naughtiness has disappeared. Checkout the logos on the right of the "Contact detail" page and the ones in Safari browser's toolbar. I am sure we'll have no problem finding and using those buttons to perform the tasks but somehow I am left to want a bit more. I want "that bite". I want some personality. Something beyond a sleek and minimal design. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"><img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"></a></p>
<p>The two answer incoming call interfaces below left wondering <strong>whether the "slide to answer" new design is a bit too clever</strong>.  One the left, the green square is clearly a button. Click to answer.  On the right though, the same green square requires a "slide".  It looks like a light will slide across the surface to indicate an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a> to "slide", but maybe it is a bit too subtle? </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"><img alt="Slide to answer" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"></a></p>
<p>I genuinely hope that all these shortcomings are either deliberate design compromises<sup id="fnref:IAmNoDesigner"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:IAmNoDesigner" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> or Apple is well on its path to fix them, as in all 1.0 products.  The next year or two will be crucial. The best case scenario is the company lifts itself to a new solid ground for another 5-10 years solid growth.  The worst case is that the company fails to consolidate and the gaps get wider and scarier. We'll have to wait and see. </p>
