<hr>
<p>There have been a lot of articles written about the new iPhone 5 so here I will skip all the fluffy stuff and focus on four technical changes that have caught my eyes.</p>
<p>First, the new 64-bit CPU and the <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html">Object-C runtime changes</a>. This is the real deal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objective-C objects are contiguous chunks of memory. The first pointer-sized piece of that memory is the isa. Traditionally, the isa is a pointer to the object`s class. </p>
<p>ARM64 running iOS currently uses only 33 bits of a pointer, leaving 31 bits for other purposes. Class pointers are also aligned, meaning that a class pointer is guaranteed to be divisible by 8, which frees up another three bits, leaving 34 bits of the isa available for other uses. Apple's ARM64 runtime takes advantage of this for some great performance improvements.</p>
<p>Probably the important performance improvement is an inline reference count. On ARM64, 19 bits of the isa field go to holding the object's reference count inline. That means that the procedure for retaining an object simplifies to only one instruction instead of five. </p>
<p>My casual benchmarking indicates that basic object creation and destruction takes about 380ns on a 5S running in 32-bit mode, while it's only about 200ns when running in 64-bit mode. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we have the new <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/24/inside-apples-a7-chip-m7-motion-coprocessor-and-more-from-the-iphone-5s/">M7 chip</a>. This new chip makes it possible to use a few sensors without waking up the whole "computer". But if you look inside the chip, you'll see that it's only a consolidation rather than a revolutionary step as some media painted. It still doesn't include the "active display" or "touchless control" features that the <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7235/moto-x-review/4">Moto X</a> has. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>M7, which is actually an ARM Cortex-M3 part from NXP running at 180 MHz. The chip allows for low-power collection of motion data drawn from a Bosch Sensortec accelerometer, an STMicroelectronics gyroscope, and an AKM magnetometer.</p>
<p>After collecting information from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, the M7 performs some matrix math processing magic to produce an absolute orientation of the phone relative to the world. This data is then passed to the A7 in a neat package, probably in the form of three headings (roll, pitch, and yaw). </p>
<p>Using the A7 to monitor this sort of data would be mega-overkill, so the M7 was introduced to maintain a constant, low-power watch over these sensors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next is the <a href="http://www.multipath-tcp.org">Multi-Path TCP</a> support for Siri. (See the <a href="http://qz.com/126642/apples-ios7-includes-a-surprise-a-ticket-to-the-next-generation-of-the-internet/">qz coverage</a> for less-technical discussions. ) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. </p>
<p>Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother reaction to failures.
The multipath-tcp website also has a nice video demo of the technology. </p>
<p>We did a little demo of MultiPath TCP used over Ethernet/WiFi/3G on our Linux Kernel implementation. We start an ssh-session with X-redirection and launch xscreensaver demo on the distant MPTCP-capable server. We then turn off Ethernet and WiFi and thanks to MultiPath TCP the ssh-session is able to handover the traffic to 3G without interrupting the user-experience. Without our MPTCP Linux Kernel the session would simply stop working and the user would need to restart the ssh-session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last one is the two new background execution modes for apps. According to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS7.html">developer doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apps that regularly update their content by contacting a server can register with the system and <strong>be launched periodically to retrieve that content in the background</strong>. To register, include the UIBackgroundModes key with the fetch value in your app’s Info.plist file. Then, when your app is launched, call the setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval: method to determine how often it receives update messages. Finally, you must also implement the application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler: method in your app delegate.</p>
<p>Apps that use <strong>push notifications to notify the user that new content is available can fetch the content in the background</strong>. To support this mode, include the UIBackgroundModes key with the remote-notification value in your app’s Info.plist file. You must also implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method in your app delegate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chrome Apps amount to a Trojan horse for Google. By way of the Chrome browser, the company is essentially putting its own app ecosystem right on top of Windows and OS X. It’s a play that’s been months in the making. “There are still reasons why a developer would build a native app over a Chrome App today, but we’re working to tackle each one,” Rakowski says. Google began promoting a handful of Chrome Apps (then called Packaged Apps) in May. In July, its Chrome notification center was pushed out to Windows and Chrome OS users, allowing for alerts and pop-ups outside the browser window. And for months, Chrome’s developer channels have shipped with an app launcher that lives in the Windows taskbar — this launcher rolled out to the public today too.</p>
<p>The new apps look and behave much like the native apps you find on Windows and OS X. They’re built using web technologies, but also with Chrome-specific code that means they won’t be able to run on other web browsers — they’re truly Chrome apps. They can exist outside of your browser window as distinct apps, work offline, and sync across devices and operating systems. They can also access your computer’s GPU, storage, camera, ports, and Bluetooth connection. Chrome Apps are, for now, only available through Chrome on Windows or Chrome OS on a Chromebook. Mac users will have to wait another six weeks before their version of Chrome will be updated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people say "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it". That's a cop out. Businesses manage things they can't really measure the value of all the time. How do you measure the      productivity of a company's lawyers, it's marketing department, an educational institution?    You can't - but you still need to manage them (see Robert Austin for more).
I can see why measuring productivity is so seductive. If we could do it we could assess      software much more easily and objectively than we can now. But false measures only make things worse. This is somewhere I think we have to admit to our ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only thing worse than this sort of activity is when people, students and teachers alike, run around college campuses calling each other racists and anti-Semites. It’s born of boredom, lassitude. Too cowardly to address problems of substance where such problems actually are, we  claw at those close to us. We point to our neighbor, in the khakis and sweater, and cry foul.  It’s ridiculous. We find enemies among our peers because we know them better, and their        proximity and familiarity means we don’t have to get off the couch to dismantle them.
Did I wonder if people would think we were selling out, that we were not fulfilling the      mission they had assumed we had committed ourselves to?
No. I did not. Nor will I ever. We just don’t care. We care about doing what we want to do   creatively. We want to be interested in it. We want it to challenge us. We want it to be       difficult. We want to reinvent the stupid thing every time. Would I ever think, before I did   something, of how those with sellout monitors would respond to this or that move? I would not.</p>

        <h2>- bestof</h2>
<p>People ask me "why do you build <a href="http://choir.io">choir.io</a>". Yes,
the <a href="http://choir.io/player/f9c750f2bedb0c0f">Github Realtime Activity</a> 
demo is cool, but are you really going to bet your next startup on this?" </p>
<p>My answer is yes and this post explains why. </p>
<p>Five years from now, most of us will handle
casual computing tasks with wearable computers.  We don't know what 
the devices might look like but it's almost certain that we will be 
communicating with them using voice commands.  Google Moto X's 
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522054/moto-x-always-listening-voice-commands-new-notifications">"always listening"</a>
feature enables us to talk to the phone without having to launch an 
app. Google's voice search is finally fast enough to keep up with 
my natural speaking speed. </p>
<p>However, the options for computers to communicate back to us 
are still very limited. Your email client might play a ding sound
when a new email arrives. But the sound stays the same regardless of whom 
the mail is sent from and how important it is to you.  </p>
<p>Our ears are born multi-tasking masters. As I am
typing this, I could hear the heat pump's humming, 
the wind blowing the leaves and the light tapping of snow flakes on the 
window.  All at the same time. </p>
<p>We can also, almost effortlessly, notice changes of a sound among 
different background "noises".  Without looking out of the window, I can tell 
that the snow has just turned into a sleety rain, because the soft snow
falling sound has become much louder as the ice hitting the ground. </p>
<p>Sound is the perfect medium for wearable computers to talk back to us. 
Sound has a dozen of properties that we can tune to convey different 
level of emotions and intrusiveness.  Different sound packs would fit 
into various contexts. </p>
<p>This is where Choir comes in. Choir provides a programmable
interface to translate events into a rich set of context-aware sounds.
Our users mark events with emotions and intrusivenss and we take care of the
rest. </p>
<p>Is Choir too early for the market? Certainly not. Choir has three 
killer applications. </p>
<p>First, ambient sound monitoring. By associating user or server 
activities with different sounds, you can stay aware of the current statuses
without having to look at the graphs. If something unusual happens, you would
hear the changes almost subconsciously.  Failed login requests, rejected 
credit card transactions, 500 errors are a few good examples here. </p>
<p>Second, notify without interruptions. Today your notifications are 
mostly delivered via email or chat room messages. You have to bear the cost
of context switches to checkout these messages.  Choir can provide you 
with a more fine-grained control over different type of notifications. 
For example, you might choose to play a pleasant, low-intrusive sound
when a user gives a kudos to a support ticket, but you would probably want to
select a negative and intrusive sound, maybe a sea monster roar, if a 
user just unsubscribed from your service. If you hear too many of the 
scary sea monster noises, you will know something is wrong. </p>
<p>Third, celebrate with others.  Some companies would hit a giant
gone when they close a new deal. It is a great morale booster to bring 
the whole team together and share the excitement of successes. 
Now you could configure Choir to play a cheerful sound when a new paid
user sign up for your service. </p>
<p>If you are interested to give Choir a go, please request an invite at 
<a href="http://choir.io">http://choir.io</a>. You can also visit our <a href="http://choir.uservoice.com">support
forum</a> and tell us what you think. 
We'd love to hear from you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did not premeditate anything. I just winged it, and when I saw problems I triaged them. The Slashdot system was very much evolved and not designed.   One thing I learned is don’t spend your entire life playing predictive defense against attacks that will never happen. Real people are very clever. If they choose to attack you they’ll attack you in ways you can’t predict.
Most people are just purely passive consumers, and that’s okay. I think a lot of people in this space obsess too much over trying to convert passives into actives. Some people are just wired to be that kind of person. Others aren’t. That’s okay.
With more and more voices, you tend toward broader subjects. Eventually it becomes less and less interesting. But what’s interesting to [me] isn’t always the thing that’s most lucrative. I had a pretty strong belief that the population of Slashdot users was relatively fixed. That makes for a crappy business model. You want to have a million really good users and be done? How does make the chart go up and to the right?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/hemingway-lookalike-contest_n_3690493.html?utm_hp_ref=arts">Hemingway lookalike contest</a>: <a href="http://corte.si">Aldo</a> described Hemingway using following terms: "full of action, well seasoned, brilliant, paranoid, depressed and committed suicide".  I found only the real photo captures all these characters. The participants seems to lack one of these "action, brilliant or depressed".  I happend to notice that his left eye seems to lack the paranoid and a color of brilliance. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070916132644AAArXuY">Turned out</a> "Hemingway's left eye was defective from birth ... In May of 1918, Hemingway wanted to join the Army but could not due to a defective left eye which he inherited from his mother."</p>

Slow to index. Slow to query. It bloats the code base. I don't know why this feature needs to be built in the first place. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>InnoDB FTS fills a need for those people who want the features and capabilities of InnoDB but can’t modify their existing applications or who just don’t have enough FTS traffic to justify building out a Sphinx/Solr/Lucene-based solution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is anyone still printing photos? 
Research firm InfoTrends did a survey of Internet connected households in EU, and photo printing went up 11% in 2012 compared to 2007-2008. Similarly, U.S.-based online photo printing has become a big deal, growing by about 20% annually between 2007-2012 according to market research firm IbisWorld. Three significant reasons for this growth are: the adoption of digital cameras, ability to transport photos online, and the increase in broadband and mobile Internet connections.
48% of the online photo printing market in the U.S. being prints on paper..   11.2% canvas and frame prints; 19.7% photobooks</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2012/10/30/why-i-subscribe-to-the-ann-arbor-chronicle/">Why I subscribe to the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>: My ideal local newspaper in 2020 will be one run by volunteers, locals vote for issues to be covered and volunteers would write subjective report. Ann Arbor Chronicle's donation increase over the last a few years seems to confirm the possibility of this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Launched in September 2008, the Ann Arbor Chronicle is an online newspaper that focuses on civic affairs and local government coverage. Although we’d likely be classified by most folks as “new media,” in many ways we embrace an ethos that runs contrary to current trends: Longer, in-depth articles; an emphasis on factual accuracy and thoroughness, not speed; and an assumption that our readers are thoughtful, intelligent and engaged in this community.</p>

<p><a href="http://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/">What the Heck is Shadow DOM?</a>: HTML's own way for building custom controls. The idea is there could a hidden dom structure that's normally hidden from javascript and css. The custom control author can choose to expose some of it via psuedo-selectors. <code>&lt;input type="slider"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> are good examples. More concrete use cases can be found <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Component_Model_Use_Cases">here</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2013/08/01/staring-at-the-sun-dalvik-vs-spidermonkey/">Staring at the Sun: Dalvik vs. ASM.js vs. Native</a>: Javascript does have the promise of a popular language. It's messy. It's ugly. It has layers and layers of patches yet everytime you feel it has hit a wall, a project like <a href="http://asmjs.org">asm.js</a> will come and lift it into stratosphere. 
Sometimes I do hope that WebOS would make it to the end if the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem">webkit issues were that easy to solve</a>. I sincerely wish FireFox and Mozilaa best luck in breaking up the walled gardens. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Asm.js is reasonably competitive with native C++ code on ARM. Even discarding the one score where asm.js did better, it executes at around 70% of the speed of native C++ code. These results suggest that apps with high performance needs can use asm.js as the target of choice for critical hot-path code, achieving near native performance.</li>
<li>Asm.js competes very well on mobile performance compared to Dalvik. Even throwing out the benchmarks that are highly favourable to asm.js (binary-trees and fasta), there seems to be a consistent 10-50% speedup over comparable Dalvik code.</li>
