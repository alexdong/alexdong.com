      <p>Just saw the news of Jeff Bezos' divorce on TV. This made me feel quite
sad. As a complete outsider, I wouldn't really know what's going on
behind the scenes but I always thought the marriage between an avid book
reader and an novelist would last forever.</p>
<p>I thougth of a <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbezos/status/992765968182001665?lang=en">tweet Bezos
sent</a>
last May.  It's a quote from Emerson which Bezos printed out and put
onto his fridge so he can look at it everyday. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and
the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics
and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to
find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a
healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know
even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to
have succeeded."</p>
