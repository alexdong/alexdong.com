    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Property investor believes in the average numbers and she seeks above
average opportunities. Value investor believes in 80/20 rule and she
looks for outliers.  </p>
<p>Property investor focuses on the middle part of the bell curve. Value
investor spends her time at the tail end.</p>
<p>Property investor expects a moderate return on her investment. Value
investor bets on 10x returns from her money.</p>
<p>Property investor is right most of the time. Value investor is wrong
seven or eight times out of ten.</p>
<p>Property investor looks elsewhere for references to set her price. Value
investor looks into spreadsheets for models and assumptions. </p>
<p>Property investor likes a good story. Value investor likes a good story
too, but she loves a great financial model even better.</p>
<p>Property investor's main contribution is her capital. Value investor's
contribution is her thoughts, perspectives and unique understanding of a
demographic, a market or a technology. Capital is a ticket for her to
get involved.</p>
<p>There are many more property investors than value investors.  Like many
things in life, there is no right or wrong to each approach.  But as an
early stage entreprenuer, it is critical that we develop the
intellectual muscle to quickly figure out what makes the other person
tick. </p>
