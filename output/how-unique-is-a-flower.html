      <p>Life is fuzzy and poetic. </p>
<p>Numbers are clean and precise.  </p>
<p>We should develop the muscle to appreciate both. After all, we are born
with a right brain for intuition and a left brain for logic thinking.
Why should we only use one? Why should we pit one against the other.
It's to wonderful to appreciate that every flower is unique.  It's
equally great fun to know just exactly how unique is a flower? </p>
<p>I'm a big fan of modeling and I believe that the process of building a
model helps us to gain much clarity into a topic. It gives us a sense of
agency. Instead of feeling powerless and at the mercy of a giant random
number generator in the sky, a good model helps us to understand our
world better so we know where our time and effort will give the best
return.</p>
<p>Here are a few excellent examples of a great model. Each takes a thorny
question tangled up with social and morale implications and put a
clearly defined number on them. I find them fascinating and I hope you
enjoy them too. </p>
<p>First is how much is Facebook worth to a user? Answer: $1000 per year.
Quoting from the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global
users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are
hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three
non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to
deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the
populations sampled and the auction design differ across the
experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would
require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While
the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on
the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these
services provide for their users are large.</p>
