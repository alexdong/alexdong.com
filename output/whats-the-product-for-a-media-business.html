<blockquote>
<p>Thinking back to my earliest involvement with Wired magazine and then launching HotWired (amazingly, almost 20 and 18 years ago respectively), I am continually impressed with how much fun the business of media can be. Media sites make for inherently cyclical, constantly transforming businesses where <strong>you’re only as good as the last story you pushed out. The people who contribute are the ultimate product — the media are just the messages.</strong> If I’ve learned anything in my few decades of experience in media, the hard part is hitching yourself to the right star.</p>
