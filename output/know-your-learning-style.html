<p>I wasn't a top student in schools. My parents got called into school to "figure out a solution" a lot often than others.  I excel in some classes like history, chemistry and math but not others like literature.  I was appalling bad at remembering all those beautiful Chinese poems no matter how many times I tried to remember them.  I have never really understood why until I took the "<a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html">learning style</a>" test.</p>
<p>During the test, you will get to answer 40 a/b questions and in the end, you'll be presented with a report like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Results for: Alex Dong</p>

<ul>
<li>If your score on a scale is 1-3, you are fairly well balanced on the two dimensions of that scale.</li>
<li>If your score on a scale is 5-7, you have a moderate preference for one dimension of the scale and will learn more easily in a teaching environment which favors that dimension.</li>
<li>If your score on a scale is 9-11, you have a very strong preference for one dimension of the scale. You may have real difficulty learning in an environment which does not support that preference.</li>
</ul>

<p>So a few interesting things I learned about myself.  <em>It's very scary to realise about this at age 35.</em>  If I have known this test early in my life, I am sure I would make a lot of choices quite differently. (Explanation can be found <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.htm">here</a>. )</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm a bit extreme on VISual vs VeRBal factor. This is exactly why I am so slow processing words, debating and remembering but I can clearly remember all the details of a street corner I drove past in a foreign city 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm a strong GLObal instead of SEQuence learner, which means I will not carefully follow through a sequence of steps and my thoughts jump around quite a bit.  This explains one long question in my mind.  No matter how hard I try, it's almost impossible for me to get a high score in exams. I often forget to read the questions fully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer to play with something to understand it, that makes me a ACTive instead of a REFlective learner.  I guess this is the reason why I prefer computer programming instead of mechanical engineering because fundamentally I need to play to understand whereas most mechanical stuffs are done in CAD software and simulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm also a INTuitive instead of SENsing learner where I hate to repeat and love to play with new things.  So trying to force myself to become a diligence worker who consistently delivers just works against my nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the future of education, I believe all kids will be "profiled" so that a personalised course set will be delivered that tailored to the student's learning style.</strong>  I can smell some opportunities around the corner here.</p>
