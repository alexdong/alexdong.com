<p><a href="http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp">Alan Kay's reading
list</a>. I decided to
read every book on this list. I'm half way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorm</a> now. Will
publish a book review when I finished it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>List view is better for phones and smaller tablets because good type design
implies a single column to achieve adequate font size and line length.
Designing a magazine or card based grid for larger tablets or desktop is a
lot of extra work for platforms that are not as rapidly growing in market
share. We wondered if these grid layouts yield enough marginal performance
gain on larger screens to offset the cost of building and maintaining them.</p>
<p>A list layout for all screen sizes is beneficial for us due to the dramatic
simplification of design and engineering problems associated with our layout
engine and the tangential benefits extending from this simplification. A list
view is easier to make responsive on all screen sizes and provides a coherent
experience across web and native apps on all devices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A doctor can find warning signs of high blood pressure, diabetes, and a whole
range of other systemic health issues, just by examining your eyes.
Ophthalmologist Neal Adams explains why the eye's tissues and blood vessels
make such a good barometer for wellness.
Sure there will be a Google Glass app for this? (Via: <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_McQueen/status/453869412857032705">@Mike_McQueen</a>)</p>
