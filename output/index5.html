<p>I have never expected this to be hard. Sure it won't be difficult to do this in 2013. But after sinking almost 1 hour into this, I decided to write it down hoping that it might save other people a bit time. </p>
<p>So I started with <a href="sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a>. I tried <code>sox zit.mp3 zit.ogg</code> and received an error message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sox FAIL formats: no handler for file extension `ogg'. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I tried <code>dir2ogg -q7 zit.mp3</code> which was recommended by a post on Ubuntu's discussion forum. But unfortunately, it still didn't work out. Here is the error message I got: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>dir2ogg 0.11.8 (2009-08-04), converts audio files into ogg vorbis.</p>
<p>WARNING: Mutagen failed on zit.mp3, no tags available
Traceback (most recent call last):

[mpg123.c:902] error: Failed to initialize output, goodbye.
ERROR: Cannot open output file "zit.ogg": Permission denied
WARNING: No tags found...
}}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After much fiddling around, this is the final solution that was working for me. To chain <code>mpg123</code> and <code>oggenc</code> together. <code>mpg123</code> will generate a <code>.wav</code>  file to the standard output, which <code>oggenc</code> takes in and emit a corresponding <code>ogg</code> file. </p>
<p><code>for i in *.mp3; do mpg321 $i -w - | oggenc -q7 -o ${i/mp3/ogg} -; done</code></p>
<p>A few caveats: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>$i</code> is the filename and <code>${i/mp3/ogg}</code> changes the output filename. </li>
<li><code>-q7</code> select a level-7 sound quality. Since both mp3 and ogg are lossy sound format, converting one to another with the same sample rate would only decrease the sound quality. By specifying a higher bit rate, the <code>ogg</code> output would sound similar to the <code>mp3</code> file. </li>
<li>The <code>-</code> are quite important. </li>
<li>On Ubuntu/Debian, you might need to install the packages using <code>sudo apt-get install mpg321 vorbis-tools</code></li>

The nature never ceases to amuse us. But human beings are the true master of drama.  Monsanto seems to be doing really well by having an increase in its pesticide product and GMO seeds. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the main arguments behind creating these engineered crops is that farmers then need to use less herbicide and pesticide.  This makes farms more eco-friendly, say proponents of genetically modified (GM) crops, and GM seeds also allow farmers to spend less on “inputs” (chemicals), thereby making a greater profit.</p>
<p>But a new study released by Food &amp; Water Watch yesterday finds the goal of reduced chemical use has not panned out as planned.  In fact, according to the USDA and EPA data used in the report, the quick adoption of genetically engineered crops by farmers has increased herbicide use over the past 9 years in the U.S.</p>
<p>Both reports focus on “superweeds.” It turns out that spraying a pesticide repeatedly selects for weeds which also resist the chemical.  Ever more resistant weeds are then  bred, able to withstand increasing amounts – and often different forms – of herbicide.</p>
<p>At the center of debate is the pesticide glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto Round Up.</p>

I think Apple is strong enough to have walked out of its youth insecurity. But still a fascinating to read: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I just noted, the great thing about productivity apps is that they add value, and the more you use them, the more valuable they become – the potential value of a productivity app is limited only by the amount of data you are willing to put into it.</p>
<p>The trouble for Apple – or any platform provider – is apps that cross that line from nice-to-have to completely irreplaceable. It’s at that point a user’s loyalty shifts from platform to app, and there are no greater examples than the aforementioned Photoshop and Microsoft Office.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Predictability and order are notspontaneous and cannot be left to the invisible hand. It takes a low-entropy carrier (no surprises) to bear high-entropy information (full of surprisal). In capitalism, the predictable carriers are the rule of law, the maintenance of order, the defense of property rights, the reliability and restraint of regulation, the transparency of accounts, the stability of money, the discipline and futurity of family life, and a level of taxation commensurate with a modest and predictable role of government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Dodd-Frank</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of financial reform should be to end this divorce between knowledge and power and ensure that most capital flows to the people who can wield it best, the entrepreneurs.  By contrast, the reform that was enacted, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, with 2,323 pages of bromides and legalese enhancing the power of regulators, moves in the opposite direction.  It increases the distance between the people in authority and the people with entrepreneurial knowledge.  It concentrates yet more power in the leviathans and their Treasury sponsors and Federal Reserve supervisors, and it imposes hundreds of new regulations on entrepreneurial finance.  Dodd-Frank sacrifices information on the altar of ignorant power.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On monetary policy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Could it be that the fundamental cause of the [2008 financial] crisis was that the monetary system, alone among the structures of capitalism, lacks a low-entropy physical layer?</p>
<p>“Over the centuries of monetary history, the remedy for unstable money has always been gold.  Critics who say the gold standard has been eclipsed by an information standard based on the Internet do not grasp the essence of information theory, which measures the information content by its ‘news’ (expressed in digital form as unexpected bits or entropy).  It takes a low-entropy carrier to bear a high-entropy newsworthy message.</p>
<p>“The 130,000 metric tons of gold that has been mined in all of human history constitutes the supreme low-entropy carrier for the upside surprises of capitalism.  Without guidance from gold, currency markets are subject to political high entropy.  They resemble a communications system without a predictable carrier that enables the information to be distinguished from the noise in the line.</p>
<p>“…Without a baseline of gold, entrepreneurship in the world economy degenerates into the manipulation of currencies for the interests of profiteers and government insiders.  This is a pathology of capitalism ….” (p. 122)</p>

<hr>
<p>First of all, I love the concept of Bitcoin. I love a currency that's outside of the
the control of governments, or law enforcement agencies.  I love 
the built-in feature of fixed number of money supply.  </p>
<p>Around 2004-06, I had similar feeling towards P2P technologies. 
I spent non-trivial amount of time reading BitTorrent's source code, following
the latest development in Distributed Hash Tables. By then, Skype was this shiny little
startup from Estonia that uses P2P to achieve significant call quality improvement with little cost.  However, almost
10 years later, P2P still hasn't been accepted by mainstream. Yet. </p>
<p>I did a quick landscape research on bitcoin recently. My feeling is that
it's still too early for us to know for sure what might come out of this experiment.  The smeared reputation as a currency for buying illegal goods, the extremely low usage of 
the currency and the government's cramp down all reminds me what has happened to 
BitTorrent and P2P technology could happen to Bitcoin as well. </p>
<p>My conclusion is Bitcoin is overvalued but it will stay high as long as US keeps printing its dollar and China keeps loaning money to the US. This does not mean Bitcoin has a bright future though unless the mainstream starts to accept it as a currency for transactions.  Here are four good links I have found on this topic. Go reading them and form your own opinion. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/trends/bitcoin-industrystartups">Bitcoin Industry Sees More Investors than Startups</a>: The increase
of Bitcoin value seems to be a result of traditional money diversifying their "portfolio"
instead of driven up by real usage. (via <a href="http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein">@joshuabrustein</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With deal activity shooting up in Q2’13 as the graph below illustrates, there are currently more venture capital and angel investors interested in the Bitcoin space than there are actual investor-backed startups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We discovered that almost all these large transactions were the descendants of a single large transaction involving 90,000 Bitcoins which took place on November 8th 2010, and that the subgraph of these transactions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of temporary intermediate accounts, or split into many small amounts which are sent to different accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into essentially the same amount in a new account.” (source: Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph.)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68438.0">Topic: Current Bitcoins in "circulation"</a>: Due to the nature of Bitcoin and how many people hold it instead of using it, it is not surprising to see that it's hard to come up with an accurate circulation number.  I don't treat this as either good or bad though.  It's this inevitable nature of Bitcoin that might surprise normal people who are used to the concept of Central Banks and controlled number of money in circulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could have a million BTC in an address that hasn't been touched for 2 years, and then add 10 BTC to it today.  That shouldn't add a million and ten to the "in circulation" number; it should just add 10 BTC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/bitcoin-bits.html">Bitcoin Bits and the market</a>: Don't call me a Bitcoin critics because I am not. I want it to succeed. It is spirit lifting to see a real world market where goods can only be bought using Bitcoin.  Usage is the oxygen to ideas. I don't believe in any other alternative ways for bitcoin to gain momentum except to have more markets like this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is truly an "open air market". Folks were buying and selling Bitcoin for cash. You'd hand someone the cash and they would take out their phone and send you the Bitcoin in a mobile wallet to mobile wallet transaction. I also bought a Bitcoin t-shirt using Bitcoin sent from my mobile wallet.
There is something real and tangible about an open air market where the only currency allowed is Bitcoin. </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>After reviewing this article, <a href="http://corte.si">Aldo Cortesi</a> gave a valuable comment on how Bitcoin is compared to P2P technology on usability and mainstream's inertia: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think P2P never caught on because a) it was never very convenient for the user, and b) it was stigmatized due to transfer of illegal/pirated content.
Structurally, Bitcoin has a better chance of actually solving some long-standing, existing user convenience issues. But its stigma problem is even greater than p2p, though.</p>

The nice thing is that we do all that fully pipelined at a rate of one message every 12 nanoseconds! To have an idea of how fast it is, in 12 ns the light will only travel 3.6 meters (11.8 ft). Another way to view this performance is that the system can process 83 Millions of financial messages per second without any queuing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The underlying value proposition by any sort of blogging engine (Posthaven, Medium, Svbtle, et al) is limited to a network, ease of use, and a good design. For most tech people, ease of use is a non-factor (you can extol 'distractions-free design', but you can put vim or Byword in full-screen mode) -- and I think the way people are reading is shifting away from individual sites and towards external services to the extent that design isn't a huge factor (everything looks the same in NewsBlur or Instapaper.)

To put it bluntly, the rest of the country doesn’t like us– any of us– anymore. We’ve lost that good faith, in technology, that allowed us to be rich (well, a few of us) and not hated, even in the midst of a transformational, generation-eating recession. 2013 will be remembered as the year when popular opinion of “Silicon Valley” imploded.</p>

And at the time of the sale to Yahoo!, he owned a very nice stake in the business even though he had raised well north of $100mm. He did that by keeping his rounds small in the early days and only scaling them when he had to and the valuations offered were much higher.</p>

Water is also easy to handle, meaning the craft can be resupplied as needed, something that is much more difficult to do with chemical rocket fuels, especially cryogenic fuels.

Søren Kierkegaard argues like anxiety comes naturally with the ability to create. Anxiety often triggers another emotion guilty. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rollo May dived into the guilty part deeper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>creating also means destroying the status quo of one’s environment, breaking the old forms; it means producing something new and original in human relations as well as in cultural forms (e.g., the creativity of the artist). Thus every experience of creativity has its potentiality of aggression or denial toward other persons in one’s environment or established patterns within one’s self.

<p>And as a journalist and activist, Mr. Greenwald could not resist a jab. “I have seen all sorts of so-called objective journalists who have all kinds of assumptions in every sentence they write,” he said. “Rather than serve as an adversary of government, they want to bolster the credibility of those in power. That is a classic case of a certain kind of activism.”</p>

<p>As Westerners, we believe in pushing up against the limits, and going over them: we’re pedal to the metal, giving 110%, and our amps go to 11. We max ourselves out in every facet of our lives: our finances, our relationships, our health, and our careers. ... The problem with being maxed out is you can’t deal with anything new. I couldn’t fit anything else in.</p>

<p><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/12/money/">Making Money on the Web: Ads versus Paywall</a> A rare glimpse into how much money a pro-blogger makes. Hint, not a lot. 
Ad supported: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made on average $2,100 a month. My stats were 50,000 uniques and 150,000 page views a month with 8,200 subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After paywall and the $40/year membership fee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how many members do I have? Roughly 255 right now. Again, I don’t know if that is good or horrible. It amounts to a little less than $1,000 a month after fees and such. So less than half of what I was making before.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will he keeps on having the paywall? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that the member base is very stable. That I barely gain new members each month, and likely if I want to up the membership I will need to talk about the membership more. Since putting up the paywall I’ve been able to stop caring about stats and money. All I focus on is writing and that’s way better. Yes there is a little bit of support, but far less than the work it took to fill RSS slots, or mentally think about keeping up page views to try and get better ad rates.</p>

<p><a href="http://henryr.github.io/cap-faq/">The CAP FAQ</a>: CAP is one of those fundamental concept I hope more engineers understand, no matter which kind of database technology you use. MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak. They are all trying to accomplish at most two of the three properties as defined by CAP. I can't imagine a civilized and in-depth discussion on database technology without knowing the other party has a solid grasp of the CAP theory.</p>
<p><a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/06/19/frequency-trails/">Frequency Trails</a>: What's fascinating about this is the comparison with heatmap and the affordance of color and line in data visualization tasks. <em>Frequency trails are [...] developed to study the finer details of hundreds of measured latency distributions from production servers, and in particular, to study latency outliers. ... Frequency trails use height to show the frequency of data rather than color, and provide higher resolution for outliers. Subtle details can be more easily seen by small variations in height, rather than small variations in color saturation.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://chomsky.info/interviews/20130528.htm">The Kind of Anarchism I Believe in, and What's Wrong with Libertarians</a>: I like and respect Chomsky but I am suspicious of anything that can be summarized into a word ends with an -ism.  <em>anarchism [...] is a tendency that is suspicious and skeptical of domination, authority, and hierarchy. It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified. It assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them. Their authority is not self-justifying. They have to give a reason for it, a justification. And if they can't justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just. ... Well what's called libertarian in the United States, which is a special U. S. phenomenon, it doesn't really exist anywhere else -- a little bit in England -- permits a very high level of authority and domination but in the hands of private power: so private power should be unleashed to do whatever it likes.</em></p>

Numba stands out brilliantly: <em>a single function decorator results in a 1300x speedup of simple Python code. I'm becoming more and more convinced that Numba is the future of fast scientific computing in Python.</em> Two things makes it so fast: 1) no dynamic type checking; 2) a new <code>autojit</code> that leverages the llvm;  (Via: <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterlemon">Nick Philips</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/paul-irish-on-chrome-moving-to-blink">Paul Irish on Chrome Moving to Blink</a>: The part I really like: <em>Let me take a moment to provide my own perspective on Dart. :) Now, as you know, I’m a JavaScript guy, so early on, I took a side and and considered Dart an enemy. JavaScript should win; Dart is bad! But then I came to realize the Dart guys aren’t just setting out to improve the authoring and scalability of web application development. They also really want the web to win. Now I’ve recently spoke about how The Mobile Web Is In Trouble, and clarified that my priorities are seeing it provide a fantastic user experience to everyone. For me, seeing the mobile web be successful trumps language wars and certainly quibbling over syntax. So I’m happy to see developers embrace the authoring advantages of Coffeescript, the smart subset of JavaScript strict mode, the legendary Emscripten &amp; asm.js combo, the compiler feedback of TypeScript and the performance ambitions of Dart. It’s worth trying out technologies that can leapfrog the current expectations of the user experience that we can deliver. Our web is worth it.</em></p>
