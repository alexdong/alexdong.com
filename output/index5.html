        <h2>- design</h2>
<p>(If you are looking for polarized rants as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>, this  is not for you.)</p>
<p>I love Apple. Before Apple, design was a luxury item that quite often was left to the last stage of product development. After Apple, it has become a top priority.  As an engineer with 15 years training in calligraphy, I feel grateful that Apple has lifted the public's taste for good design.  I don't think I am an Apple fanboy. I am just someone who gets a bit too easily annoyed by bad designs. </p>
<p>Having said that, I have to say <strong>I am a bit let down by the new iOS 7<sup id="fnref:ContextOfDiscussion"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContextOfDiscussion" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></strong>.  Yes, it is a totally new direction for iOS. Apple needs a few iterations to consolidate and refine the design language. Yes, each product needs time to catch up with the new direction. And yes, it takes efforts and compromises to provide a smooth migration path between the old and the new.  There are many reasons I can use to justify why Apple released these products at the current stage. However deep in my heart  <strong>I worry that I might lose yet another company I love and respect <sup id="fnref:CompaniesIRespect"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CompaniesIRespect" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></strong>.</p>
<p>To get started, there are some very well designed apps. Like Clock, Weather<sup id="fnref:ContrastOfWeather"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContrastOfWeather" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and Compass. These designs have nothing loose or left unsettled.  Whitespace ample and balanced. Functions laid out clearly. No surprise. No guess work. Everything is where they should be. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"><img alt="Well designed apps" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"></a></p>
<p>Do keep in mind though that there are little design-tech-feature tensions here though. The feature sets of these apps are well defined so it's mainly a design exercise. So these are the easy ones. </p>
<p>Once we get over simple ones, I start to see inconsistent metaphors.  For example, here are 3 apps all offering the ability to select media from a library. I am particularly perplexed by the newsstand app. On one hand, its "store" sits on the bottom "frosted glass" toolbar, which is kind of new metaphor. On the other hand, it seems to carry with it the old skeuomorphism of a physical magazine stand. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"><img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is another example. There are 2 ways to select from a range of screens. The left is the new "look-down" view on a list of open tabs in Safari. Flip up-and-down to navigation, click the small x on top right corner to delete. The right one is the new screen manager. Flip left-to-right to navigate, swipe to the top to close one.  I'm not sure why Apple releases two totally new yet visually so different ways for the same task. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"><img alt="Tab selection metaphor" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"></a></p>
<p>Besides the inconsistent metaphors, I have to admit that I feel the new "simplified" interface maybe have gone a bit too far in some apps. </p>
<p>The logos feel a bit "too simple". They <strong>feel like the Apple logo without the bite</strong>.  The naughtiness has disappeared. Checkout the logos on the right of the "Contact detail" page and the ones in Safari browser's toolbar. I am sure we'll have no problem finding and using those buttons to perform the tasks but somehow I am left to want a bit more. I want "that bite". I want some personality. Something beyond a sleek and minimal design. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"><img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"></a></p>
<p>The two answer incoming call interfaces below left wondering <strong>whether the "slide to answer" new design is a bit too clever</strong>.  One the left, the green square is clearly a button. Click to answer.  On the right though, the same green square requires a "slide".  It looks like a light will slide across the surface to indicate an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a> to "slide", but maybe it is a bit too subtle? </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"><img alt="Slide to answer" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"></a></p>
<p>I genuinely hope that all these shortcomings are either deliberate design compromises<sup id="fnref:IAmNoDesigner"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:IAmNoDesigner" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> or Apple is well on its path to fix them, as in all 1.0 products.  The next year or two will be crucial. The best case scenario is the company lifts itself to a new solid ground for another 5-10 years solid growth.  The worst case is that the company fails to consolidate and the gaps get wider and scarier. We'll have to wait and see. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/StandingOvation.MillerPage.pdf">Standing Ovation Problem</a> is a social science model that is extremely simple yet "provides a rich domain to explore the world".  Here is how a SOP is defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A brilliant economics lecture ends and the audience begins to applaud. The applause builds and tentatively, a few audience members may or may not decide to stand. Does a standing ovation ensue or does the enthusiasm fizzle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can watch Scott explains the theory in this <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking-2012-002/lecture/11">18-minutes video</a> but here is the gist of the theory. The following 6 factors have a strong impact on whether a standing ovation happens or not. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Higher quality</li>
<li>Lower Threshold: how easy the audiences are to be satisfied. </li>
<li>Larger Peer Effects: how likely the audiences are influenced by each other. </li>
<li>More variation</li>
<li>Use celebrities</li>
<li>Big groups. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The first three are self explainable and in most cases out of our control. What's more fascinating are 4-6. Let's dive into each one a bit more. </p>
<p>First, <strong>more variation</strong>. Let's say there are two groups. Each group has 6 people. Here is the number of other people who has to stand up before one stand up: <code>(1, 1, 1,  2, 2, 2)</code>. This basically says that for three people in the group, if they see one person stand up, they will stand up. The other three needs two people. Say we have a second group like this <code>(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code>. <code>0</code> means the person will stand up no matter how others behave and <code>5</code> means that dude is really reluctant to change his body position unless almost everyone is doing it. Which one of these two groups will be more likely to pull a standing ovation? Yes, the second one even though it has a difficulty score of <code>2.5</code> whereas the first group has only <code>1.5</code>.  </p>
<p>The difference? The second group has a more varied group so that a cascading effect can happen; also it has the <code>0</code> <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.html">movement</a> guy. Without any of these two factors, getting the second group to all stand up would be hard. </p>
<p>Second, <strong>use celebrities</strong>.  The model uses celebrities to describe the people sitting at the front rows. They are not necessarily celebrities per se but they share the same traits which is they can't see other people's behavior yet everyone else can see theirs.  This gives them the power as 'magnifiers'.  <sup id="fnref:Academics"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Academics" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Third, <strong>big groups</strong>.  If people come in groups, let's say the wife stands up, there is a pretty high chance that the husband would get his bum up.  If we have an audience like this one: <code>{1: 0%, 2: 30%, 3: 30%, 4: 20%, 5: 10%, 6: 10%}</code>, which is a group that's hard to please. Having a couple to stand up would be sufficient to <em>tip</em> the whole audience over even if no one would stand up without two other people do it before them. </p>
<p>To apply this theory to user acquisition is a fun exercise. If we have a software product that makes it really easy for people to have a link blog<sup id="fnref:WeAreBuildingOne"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:WeAreBuildingOne" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, basically to share interesting links in the form of a blog like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/">DaringFireball</a>, here is a list of things that could be done to help getting new user sign ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides getting onto the radar of big social news sites, finding many topic niches where people tie closely together would be important too. Say targeting niches where there is at least a forum for people to hang out. </li>
<li>Groups with larger peer effects would be the natural candidates. These are the groups where people pays lots of attention to each other and eager to jump onto the new bandwagon. </li>
<li>For each group, find out who are the celebrities and get them to use the service first. Then we can go after the other group members by leveraging the first batch of 'celebrities'</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:Academics">
<p>The people sit in the last role is defined as academics, which I find quite funny. The nature of the academics is that they can see everyone yet no one can see them.

<hr>
<p>Once in a while, I would read an article and found myself
keeps nodding my head.  Alex Payne's recent post <a href="http://al3x.net/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-young-programmer.html">A letter to a young programmer</a> is such a gem.
For quite a while, I have wanted to write about the four common myths about startup. 
Alex has managed to cover all of them. So here is my attempt to tell the same story
from my own perspective. </p>
<p><strong>1. Startup means working on brand new things. </strong>  Actually the startup world is 
full of people moving in herds. Majority of the times you will be working on 
projects that are applying existing knowledge to solve new problems. 
People who are doing never-seen-before stuff might have problems to get
attractions. Sure you have watched this video Pinterest's 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGgyma8cALQ">Ben gave at YC Startup School 2012</a>? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups are portrayed as an exciting, risky, even subversive alternative to
traditional corporate work. ... the culture of most startups is blandly uniform,
right down to a style of dress and grooming that helps “startup guys” – and all
too often are they guys – stay with their herd </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Working for startups are glamorous and always fun. </strong>.  One advice I often give 
to job seekers is to look for the words a job posting uses. If there are
an excessive usage of "fun", "exciting", be careful.  These could be cheap tricks 
like feeding baby candies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the company-provided keg runs dry, the free lunches are making you fat, and
playing the Xbox in the break room is no longer as fun as it used to be, what then?
When you find that you now report to a politicking middle manager and not the
inspiring CEO who interviewed you, will you still want to be there? Is a supposedly
novel working environment enough to sustain you? When everywhere you might consider
working looks more or less the same, is the novelty even there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. If you follow the lean methodology, you'll win. </strong> People say that my eyes start 
to roll over when I hear "lean", "MVP" or "agile". It is not that I don't think these 
are right ideas. Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it's a sin to expand the team 
if you haven't figured out your business model, user acquisition channel and costs yet. 
However, there are so much more than simply reparaphrasing the sentences in 
"Lean Startup" or "4-steps to Epiphany".  Startup is essentially a walk in the dark. 
You have to <strong>feel your ways</strong> and <strong>use your own judgement</strong> a lot. And no surprisingly 
the judgements get honed only when you make mistakes. Quite often, the more painful it
hurts, the better you learned. Reading 10 books wouldn't help a bit because you're
always interpretating the text from the old perspective. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups have been systematized, mythologized, culturally and socially de-risked;
reduced down to formulas and recipes. Yet, there is no enduring formula for
creativity and rebellion. When we attempt to factory farm innovation we breed out
the very thing we’re trying raise: the creative destruction that stokes and
re-stokes the fire of capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Startup means working your ass off and say goodbye to personal life. </strong>
Bragging of "macho heroics" of pulling a all-nightter will only make one look
naive. I'll still do it if the server goes down or there are some <em>real</em> deadlines 
I have to make. But I no longer do it because it makes me feel good. 
I've done plenty of those 36-hour non-stop coding thing and now looking back, I feel 
sorry for my younger self.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups appeal to a desire for daring that’s lost in many forms of modern work, and
we’re told stories of the rewards waiting when personal lives are sacrificed on the
altar of the launch schedule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarily, if you meet me on the street and ask "are you busy", I will be
very hesitated to say I am. Being busy is the same way to admit 
that I fail to use my judgement to prioritize things, or I am unable to leverage 
the resources I have, or I seriously underestimate the work required, or I didn't 
code things up properly that I haven't been caught off guard by some accidents, or,
worst of all, I forgot about the whole point of why I started companies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen firsthand the damage that startups can
do to relationships. I’ve watched marriages and friendships fall apart, seen
children and partners pushed aside, and failed those in my life in all kinds of ways
when work came to the fore. I’ve listened as people who are the very picture of
startup success – visible in the press and social media, headlining conferences,
forever founding and exiting – have confided their utter loneliness despite
being seemingly at the social center of the entrepreneurial community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been working 14 years now. Half of which I worked for corporates, half I 
built startups.  Having said all these, I'd like to say that I enjoy working on
startups because <strong>it's the best way to understand and improve oneself</strong>. 
When there is no room for
<a href="http://au.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-on-the-difference-between-a-vice-president-and-a-janitor-2011-5">execuses</a>, feedback loops start to run faster and one
benefits the most.  It's still the most rewarding experience, as long as
we get the expectations right. </p>

<p>The most important job as a founder is to build a healthy growth-quality ratio into the company's culture. A startup with great software but small number of users has only modest success. A company enjoying a dominate market share with poor quality products will gradually see its users shifting away.</p>
<p>From a businessman's perspective, quality is only one of many factors that determines whether the company will succeed. The quality needs to be good, but not necessarily great. The quality should be good enough so that the <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/Act_Your_Age.html">middle of the bell curve</a> is happy. Any further investment in quality is a waste of opportunities. Market share growth can fix quality problems because the company will have time to go back and refine the product. Microsoft and Cisco are two companies who are famous for their continuous improvement approach. They would bombard a new industry with shitty 1.0 products and then keep releasing better quality every release. PG's essay on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">startup = growth</a> is a good argument for this point of view <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>From a craftsman's perspective, quality is the most important factor.  Growth is the natural next step. If you build an excellent product, people will come <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The product will <a href="http://www.mintel.com/blog/new-market-trends/good-product-mostly-sells-itself-good-product-doesnt-need-excessive-marketing">mostly sell itself</a>. It will help you to focus on doing what you're really good at. The craftsman's reputation would accumulate slowly over the years and this "branding" will gradually deliver a very nice compound interest <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. 37signals' products are great but not 100 times better than their competitors. It is their reputation from RoR and the clear <a href="http://37signals.com/rework">stance</a> that catapult them to such a high level. </p>
<p>It is naive to say one approach is better than the other. Although given the constraints of resources, startups usually have to pick one at the cost of the other. </p>
<p>The best companies are the ones who have an excellent and healthy execution on both growth and quality. </p>
<p>Apple has a few products that are good enough to be <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=22559">collected by MOMA</a>, yet its quarter-by-quarter growth has given it a tremendous scale advantage to build a highly optimized supply-chain.  When people says "if it weren’t for Tim Cook, the <a href="http://au.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3?nr_email_referer=1">iPad would cost $5,000</a>", they really meant that it's the growth that allows Apple to cut down their cost that much. </p>
<p><strong>As a artistic software craftsman, this is a reminder to myself to have more businessman's view in our company.

<p><a href="http://techland.time.com/author/hmccracken/">Harry McCracken</a> at Times wrote in his post <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/05/16/the-tragic-beauty-of-google/">The Tragic Beauty of Google+</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The service, which was already pretty darn slick, is now among the most attractive and engaging web apps I’ve ever seen. ... it (Google+) now has its own style and signature features. ... It’s fun to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. It's not. <strong>It sacrifices the usability of the product in exchange of a superficial look of pretty.</strong>  The design stands in the way of presenting the content.  It is easy to whip up a "beautiful" page by throwing together some nice fonts and high quality pictures.  But engaging? Fun to use? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Here are the three major problems I noticed.</p>
<p>First, <strong>images are out-of-proportionally big.  They steal the attention away from the texts.</strong> Here is the <a href="https://plus.google.com/explore">What's Hot</a> page.</p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming2.png"><img alt="Image too overwhelming" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming2.png"></a></p>
<p>It looks pretty because of the two high quality photos which have taken up the majority of screen real estate.  You eyes will inevitably look at Larry's face and the new Android Studio but did you notice much of the text at all? Did you realize that Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA? (That news is, in my opinion, probably the most important and positive one for the Android developer community.)</p>
<p>Here is what I get if I hide all the images.</p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming-no-image-.png"><img alt="Image too overwhelming no image-" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming-no-image-.png"></a></p>
<p>Do you notice the text content better? Do you realize how huge those images were?  Sure this can't be a good design unless Google+ wants to become the next pinterest clone.</p>
<p><strong>The second problem is that the reading experience is weakened even further by endless demands for actions.</strong>  Google+ constantly asks you to do things. Lots of them.  Now, go ahead and count how many actions you are suppose to do in the following page.</p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Too-noisy-too-many-actions2.png"><img alt="Too noisy, too many actions" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Too-noisy-too-many-actions2.png"></a></p>
<p>I found 27, how about you? This does not even include the 3 drop down lists which will certainly give you more work.  And we are cheating a bit here. The space taken up by "Where did you go to school?" block could easily pile in another 10+ actions if it's a normal news block.</p>
<p><strong>Third problem, the lack of discipline in using the whitespace.  </strong>Whitespace is one of the most powerful, visually pleasing and least intrusive way to bring orders and visual hierarchies to a design. Yet what do you think of the whitespace in this <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23python"><em>Best of</em> #Python</a> page?</p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Best-of-python2.png"><img alt="Best of #python" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Best-of-python2.png"></a></p>
<p>What is this?! The only thing that seems to be useful is this one single line: "Hy: Lisp subset that compiles to Python". The rest of the screen space? Wasted.</p>
<p>Let's take a step back and think about what's the goal for Google+. It's fundamentally a river of short messages that might be interesting to the user.  I imagine most of the times people would just scroll through and see whether something catches their eyes. The new Google+ fails to deliver an experience that maximizes this goal.</p>
<p>PS. Even at a pure visual design level, Google+ is still not up to the standard. The vertical alignments, margin between elements within one block would use more refinement. The avatar is inconsistent. Sometime they're round.  Most of the times square. But arguing design for design's sake is missing the point here. It has to be functionally useful first. Without that, it's a castle on the sand.</p>

<p>W<strong>hat represents a good entrepreneur</strong>?   Some would think a talented engineer furiously coding on a clever algorithm; or the CEO in his suit winning some award.  I think those are only a tiny fraction of startup life. They are not as interesting as one might think.  If you are an experienced programmer and you know what needs to be done,  you just go ahead and code the solution out.  It's like a good walk in a park.  Enjoyable but nothing fancy.  Winning awards? It's an important milestone but not a good indication of the process.</p>
<p>I think <strong>it's the ability to make good decisions</strong>.   By definition, a good entrepreneur is the one who makes most important decisions right.  A corollary is that for a startup with two founders, it's about make the right decisions together.</p>
<p><strong>The two founders should come out of the debate with a better  idea, one that weren't there in their mind before the debate started.  </strong>This would require the two founders to sit down,  carefully listen to what the other is saying,  comb through what works and what not, acknowledge the weakness of his own solution and, usually as a by-product of doing all the above, creatively come up a brand new idea that takes the best parts from both while avoiding the known problems. If you can do that, you've got a winning team.</p>
<p>PS. When people say a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">solo founder is really hard</a>,  they probably mean solo founder doesn't have someone to bounce off ideas with.  Hence he may miss the opportunity to get to a better solution.  So in my opinion, if you are a solo founder, go find yourself a strong advisory board, have someone you trust and use them to tease out the best ideas that weren't in your mind.</p>

<p>I'm on the advisory board of the dental software company Software Surgery.  We have had such a frustrating experience applying for a <a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/update-me/archive/frst-funding-archive/technz-terms-and-conditions/">TechNZ</a> funding that I believe <strong>New Zealand needs a government grant/funding option designed specifically for software startups. </strong> The current system is probably well designed for manufacturing products but they are just unsuitable for software projects who can use helps from the government.</p>
<p>To evaluate a software startup's worth, I'd look at three things: idea, founders and the market.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: dentists are still referring patients to each other using paper based forms. Every year, there would be patients who "fall through the crack" and, as a consequence, their treatments were delayed. Bad things happened. The dentists get severe penalty. Yet dentists are among the most busiest people in all professions. They are constantly under time pressure and unhappy patients.  Stacy's software makes it really easy for dentists to track and follow through a case to make sure the referrals have been taken care of.  Clear problem. Well designed solution.</p>
<p>Solid team. <a href="http://nz.linkedin.com/pub/stacy-hunt/38/aa0/251">Stacy</a>, the CEO and founder of the company has sold his previous company in 2003; He is building the product using his own money from selling the previous one.  Before taught himself design and programming, Stacy spent more than 15 years as a dentist.  I haven't seen anyone who have so much in-depth knowledge in programming, design and dental industry.  Talking about domain knowledge and startup experience, I wouldn't expect anyone better than Stacy to take on a dental software.  Besides We also have <a href="http://nz.linkedin.com/pub/john-hamilton/58/216/a85">John Hamilton</a>, who sits on the Dental Council of New Zealand as another advisor.  John has to write reports for different medical cases due to "referral  accidents". He has personally made sure that the software is usable and provide the tools and workflow dentists would use. And no more.</p>
<p>The market: there are more than 2000 dentists in New Zealand. More in Australia, UK and around the world. Most dental clinics have computers but no one so far can track referrals, check updates, provide great tools to attach X-ray pictures. Mature market. Ready for the product.</p>
<p>Yet, as we went through the TechNZ process, we have to answer questions that are just utterly unfit for software projects which moves really fast and the margin to replicate is near to zero.  My favorite one is a table to fill in a year-to-year "revenue project for 7 years".  <strong>7 freaking years!  </strong>I believe the people working in government's Economic Development Unit have the best intention to make sure that tax money are not wasted.  But with the wrong framework and process, they <strong>are</strong> wasting time and money.  Even worse, they are not solving the problem but they have become part of the many obstacles that an entrepreneur needs to overcome.</p>
<p>The following is the email Stacy sent to withdraw his application, which gives an excellent view on the different between a software project and a typical 'industrial' project.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'd like to withdraw the grant application, because now that I've seen more of the process involved in the grant it's become apparent that our project isn't a good fit for it.</p>
<p>In the environment that we operate in, key attributes are agility and responsiveness. Once users get their hands on our product, we'll need to be able to rapidly and probably quite dramatically adapt our plan and processes to what we discover. Very small details which can't be predicted can alter how we need to proceed. For example, it may be that users see value in some aspect of our solution that we hadn't anticipated and we need to change our sales model to give away for free what we had intended to charge for in order to leverage that value. I could give you a list of imagined cases with a risk assessment and mitigation plan for each, but it would be truly pointless; what I can tell you for sure is that whatever we try to predict, the reality will be different.</p>
<p>I agree that there's a need for diligence in administering grants - it's just a question of degree, or the level of detail that is useful. At one extreme is a guy who has a concept but no clue how to build it or market it; at the other is a guy who spends 10 years planning out every minute detail and never builds anything (I'm referring to "paralysis by analysis" here). Real startup projects sit at various places on that spectrum, and the art is knowing how much planning is helpful and how much is a hindrance.</p>

<p>I'm an investor in this project, and I wouldn't have spent a cent on it until I got a team together that I was confident would be able to adapt and solve problems across the full range - business strategy, sales, design, development and administration. The key difference is that I believe the greatest risk mitigation strategy in this environment is the team iteself; predicting the details of what the team is going to encounter may create the illusion of certainty at the outset but it quickly becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>The other issue that I'm encountering is that the process is too slow for our project, and the time that I need to invest in creating the illusion of certainty is a risk to the project in itself. We've already started spending on it and because only expenses after the approval date are eligible, the value of the grant to the project has already changed significantly. In other words, the project needs to move rapidly and the grant process can't move rapidy - so again it doesn't seem like a good fit.</p>
<p>I hope that this makes some sense. It's a complex decision and I can't give you a rich understanding of where I'm coming from in a short Email unfortunately; but perhaps it will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Thanks to you both for the effort and time that you've put in, and no doubt there will be news about how things are going from time to time. I'm not arrogant enough to assume that it's a sure-fire thing and my approach is the only one - but from what I've seen and experienced it's the approach that I want to bet on.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/rodney-tamblyn">Rodney</a> wrote me an email responding to my previous post of "<a href="http://alexdong.com/understanding-open-source/">understand open source</a>".   His comments led me into some deeper thinking of the difference of open source and commercial software projects. And what they can learn from each other, which I will publish a post later. (Disclaimer: I'm an independent advisor to <a href="http://ob3.cc/">OceanBrowser</a>, Rodney's company.)</p>
<p>It is not my intention to draw a black-and-white line and assert "open source is all good and commercial software are just evil". Quite contrary to that, I'm strongly against monoculture. Either it's only open source or only commercial software.  Plus, these two terms not even exclusive to each other nowadays.  Android and Ubuntu are both large scale open source projects run by a commercial company, for commercial reasons.</p>
<p>So before I go on and share Rodney's reply. Let's remind ourselves that I'm also against the idea of over-generalization. So please read the following with a large grain of salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So if I am missing a needed feature in a project and I do nothing about it, it is my own fault for not getting off my lazy arse and taking advantage of the participation opensource allows."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characterizing a user as lazy because they don't want to get involved in this way isn't constructive.  The world is full of complicated things that don't work - there may be a mismatch of expectations, especially around suitability for purpose, quality, and reliability.  "taking advantage of the participation opensource allows" could be a euphism here for someone disappearing down a rabbit hole of forums, testing and so forth that completely diverts them from the user from what they were trying to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With a proprietary product, if I like it, the only way I am allowed to participate in it’s improvement is by buying it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you believe this?  Most of the people who have contributed to helping in the development of OB3 haven't directly bought it - students, teachers etc.  It suggests that closed source developers are fixated on financial returns or money as an indicator of importance.  Which I would reject, at least in our case, the contrary position is it is about control and design, it can just represent a choice about how you want to build your vision.  Then there are all the projects out there where the product is closed source but big chunks of the underlying platform are open sourced.  Or ones which are open sourced with a close source commercial build for "enterprise".</p>
<p>For the time starved user who reads the hype about some open source product, pours hours and hours into learning about it (event pit) installing and configuring, only to find that it is unstable and bug ridden, they are supposed to now fix it - or shut up?  I'm not the type that slags OS projects by the way…. just putting the contrary view here.</p>

<p>It may depend on the type of product you are talking about, and how you define what is "improving the product" - is it just engineering?  If the product needs design, research, maybe you need a team working full time on that - and someone has to pay their salaries.Anyway,  better get back to work… above could do with more drafting.  This article reduces closed source/ commercial development to a caricature - not all closed source firms are evil money focused bottom line etc…</p>

        <h2>- open source</h2>
<p>I have started doing some research on how open source communities are governed. My goal is to use today's open source projects as a way to figure out how to run a community when the only force that put people together is love and interest.  I'll publish my notes and whatever interests me along the way here.</p>
<p>This is an excellent short piece on why open source's "success" is <strong>not</strong> what a "marketer" would expect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the opensource system, if you find any deficiency in the project, the onus is on you to redress that deficiency. Opensource projects provide you with the means and mechanism to not only remove inadequecies in any part of the project but also to improve the project. Without this positive feedback loop an opensource project dies. <strong>Opensource doesnt improve by advocacy, mindshare, or by having 10 million users, it improves by the participation and contribution from the user community.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that boils down to is, if you see something wrong and do nothing about it, the opensource system hasnt failed you, <em>you</em> have failed the opensource system.</p>
<p>So if I am missing a needed feature in a project and I do nothing about it, it is my own fault for not getting off my lazy arse and taking advantage of the participation opensource allows. One of the things that really annoys me is the continual slagging of some of the other opensource projects that get more media time. It is ok slagging a proprietary product as often you have no other way of getting your neck into the user-development feedback loop. But slagging an opensource project is ignorant. The whole mechanism exists to empower the user. If there is something that would cause that person to slag a project then it means enough to them to do something about it. In simpler words, fix it! :)</p>
<p><strong>As a rule marketers count bodies</strong> lol. With a proprietary product, if I like it, the only way I am allowed to participate in it's improvement is by buying it. The more I buy, the more likely it is to be successful and provide me with something stable and persistent in the future to develop and deploy with. The more users that buy the proprietary product, add to that companies ability to improve that product. This includes not only the cost of the development but all the other stuff that goes along with it, like profit, marketing etc. So my buying dollars dont directly go to the improvement of that product, even so lots of users is good for a proprietary products future.</p>
