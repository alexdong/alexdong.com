<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/12/us/snowden-getaway-options">What are the odds of a Snowden getaway?</a>: Even reading this makes me feel cold. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of movies, near the end of the hit film "Catch Me If You Can," there's a scene that Snowden might do well to watch while he's killing time in the airport lounge (or wherever he is) pondering his fate. The young forger, Frank Abagnale, who has been staying a step ahead of the feds, finally grows irritated and fatigued. Not because they are particularly skilled in their hunting, nor because they are getting closer, but simply because they won't give up. In a fit of pique, he blurts into the phone, "Stop chasing me!" On the other end, the dogged, bureaucratic Treasury agent, Carl Hanratty, answers, "I can't stop. It's my job."
Ultimately, this is why many people who have been involved in such matters believe Snowden will be caught.  ...
They'll have to make Edward Snowden their living, because those who are chasing him already have. Government agents will be paid every minute of every day for as long as it takes. Seasons may change and years may pass, but the odds say that one morning, he'll look out of a window, go for a walk or stop for a cup of coffee, and the trap will spring shut. It will be almost like a movie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It turns out there is no JavaScript wake event. There is an online event, but it doesn’t seem to trigger whenever the computer is sent to sleep and re-awoken.
The only sure fire way I could work out to achieve this, was to run a interval and check that the it was invoked at the expected times. Any delay in an interval invocation indicates that the computer has just slept.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When "https is secure, make sure your bank uses https" permeates into the general conscience, does it become "if everything is https, everything is secure"? Does the prevalence of https inspire false confidence in the web or will people learn that https was never a good signal for determining the legitimacy of a (possibly forged) web site?</p>
