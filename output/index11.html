<p>Think it's hard to keep a balanced life? Check this one out. The ex NASA Space Shuttle Flight Director wrote how he looked back on 2002 when he <a href="http://waynehale.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/ten-years-after-columbia-balancing-work-and-life/">seems to live a balanced life but end up costing people's life</a>. Certainly not directly but ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it; the job and all my extracurricular activities, it’s a wonder I had time to sleep.  I guarantee I wasn’t bored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this walk down memory lane is not about trying to impress you; no doubt you have had similarly active times in your own life.  The point is that we started to miss critical safety issues in 2001 and 2002.  In early 2003 we paid the price for that inattention.</p>
<p>So I ask you; in a high reliability organization, one which is engaged in risky, highly complex activities with cutting edge technology; how much time does any individual need to devote to making the activity successful and safe?</p>
<p>Nothing on my list of activities was a bad thing; without a doubt I was making a difference to my family and in my community.  Some life moments are inescapable; death of a beloved family member is one of those.  No matter how far in advance you see it coming, you can never be ready for that.</p>
<p>The old saying “all work and no play makes jack a dull boy” also bears elements of truth.  Time for recreation and reflection is necessary to do ones best.</p>
<p>But in spite of all of that rationalization, a decade later, the regret over not playing a more important role, one that would have prevented the Columbia tragedy, lays like a pall over my memories of those days.</p>
<p>He grew even bitter admitting that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in a High Reliability Organization, you have to pay attention.  The more extreme the risk, the more difficult the environment, the more complex the technology, the more attention you must pay.  But life intrudes.  As the song says, there are planes to catch and bills to pay, and too there are little children to play with.  You cannot work all the time, and if the balance gets too far either way, a price will be exacted.  Once upon a time I wrote:  “pay attention, do good work, have no regrets”.  True, but far too simplistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2002 I thought we were paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I thought I was paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I was a Flight Director.  I was also a husband and a father and active in my community.  I thought I could do it all.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So work was a 60 hour a week job; it was always on my mind.  There were a thousand details to plan and decide and brief to management.  Even then I recognized that there were a million details in the shuttle business that I couldn’t participate in; there just wasn’t enough time or energy for any one person to do it all.  The folks in the shuttle program office, Ron Dittemore, Linda Ham, and the rest, they had a tough job.  Tougher than you know.  Tougher than I knew at the time.  Everybody played their part, everybody was highly motivated, everybody wanted the shuttle to succeed, and yet, within months, we were all to fail.</p>
<p>Why?  Listen and learn.  Maybe you will avoid failure.  But don’t count on it.</p>

<p>I'd say the same is true for entrepreneurs. It usually takes at least 2-3 years for a young and fresh entrepreneur to hit his own stride and know what works for him the best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In listening to both of them, I heard something that I have found to be true in my own experience. It takes time to learn how to be an early stage investor. You have to make a bunch of investments and learn from them. And you have to develop a strategy, a thesis, and your own differentiated style which people can then attach to you. In effect you have to build a brand and become known for what you do and how you do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this happens overnight. I think it took my friend about four years to hit his stride. I suspect it took the Gotham Gal about as long. Part of this is that is how long it takes to know if you've made a good investment or not. You might know in two to three years. But by four years, it is going to be pretty clear. As these outcomes start coming in, you can start to see what is working and what is not.</p>
<p>And "what is working and what is not" is not just about your investment selection. <strong>It is about the fit between you and a certain kind of entrepreneur and a certain kind of target market and a certain kind of business model. Some investors are better at investing in SAAS companies. Some are better at investing in e-commerce. Some are better at investing in mobile apps. Some investors are better at working with teams that need a lot of help. Some investors are better at working with teams that don't need any help and want you to get out of the way.</strong></p>
<p>It is important to figure out who you are and where you fit in the startup economy before you can become a good investor. But once you do that, you can "hit your stride" and start investing with conviction.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer that it is possible to build a startup community where you live.  Especially as the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">software is eating the world</a>, I see lots of opportunities when you merge local and mobile together.</p>
<p>Having said this, it won't be easy. There haven't been a clear break-out yet, although New York, Seattle, Boulder are clearly leading the game. I have been consulted on how to do that in our little town Dunedin. I've talked about local capital, proven records, good quality engineers. I have wanted to summarize it into a clearly organized todo list but luckily that has been done by a <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/">very capable VC</a>: <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/09/27/what-makes-a-successful-startup-community-is-it-possible-to-build-one-where-you-live/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BothSidesOfTheTable+%28Both+Sides+of+the+Table%29">What Makes a Successful Startup Community?

<p>Have had my own humble share of fund raising, shake the hands of investors from China, US and Australia, the following article left a deep impression on me.  For anyone who is raising capital, please keep this one in mind.   To be fair, the most successful investors start out as entrepreneurs, like Ben Horowitz, Mark Anderson. But there are also non-trivial pencentage of investors who just haven't done it before.  When they give advices, I frown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of startups, it’s convenient to read the Picasso quote as a tidy summarization of the difference between critics (VCs and the tech press) and practitioners (entrepreneurs). There is some truth to this. When entrepreneurs get together, they tend to talk about tactical details. VCs and the press talk about trends, markets, and other abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Picasso was just being modest. He thought about the meaning of his art far more deeply than his critics did. The same is true of great entrepreneurs. “Cheap turpentine” is important, but so is “Form and Structure and Meaning”. The best ideas emerge from the interplay between the two modes of thought.</p>

<p>Future usually unfolds itself bit-by-bit. And here is another crack.</p>
<p>I have long heard of the term "computational photography" where techniques like linear algebra could be used to transform one shape into another. But to see it in effect is still mind numbing. Checkout the following video where using open source software,  "people are removed from a space".  Think of surveillance devices. Think about using photo and video as evidences in court. We're truly living in an exciting time.</p>

<p>Through a process of foreground subtraction, the project removes people from a space which otherwise would be difficult to capture empty. Using either time-lapse sequences, movie scenes, or live video as the content, users are able to watch as the people begin to fade away and the background is reconstructed. The video below shows the image as it is being processed.</p>

<p>Thinking back to my earliest involvement with Wired magazine and then launching HotWired (amazingly, almost 20 and 18 years ago respectively), I am continually impressed with how much fun the business of media can be. Media sites make for inherently cyclical, constantly transforming businesses where <strong>you’re only as good as the last story you pushed out. The people who contribute are the ultimate product — the media are just the messages.</strong> If I’ve learned anything in my few decades of experience in media, the hard part is hitching yourself to the right star.</p>

<p>We all know that building a startup team is hard yet crucial.  But given so many other factors that are involved in this brutal survival game, there hasn't been much research done on answering the question: <strong>what makes up the best team?</strong> Shall we pick a group of really talented people and put them together and wait it to settle down by itself? Or maybe find a team that has done works together since they know each other much better so communication cost and team coherency is better? If the reality is somewhere between these two extreme sides, where is the balance point?</p>
<p>Finally I ran into one <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all">great and long article</a> on this topic.  The article itself has many parts to it and it's not as smooth as it could be. But there are so many nuggets it it that I strongly recommend you reading it from cover to cover.</p>
<p>Here is the answer for those impatient ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uzzi found that the people who worked on Broadway were part of a social network with lots of interconnections: it didn’t take many links to get from the librettist of “Guys and Dolls” to the choreographer of “Cats.” Uzzi devised a way to quantify the density of these connections,<strong> a figure he called Q. If musicals were being developed by teams of artists that had worked together several times before</strong>—a common practice, because Broadway producers see “incumbent teams” as less risky—<strong>those musicals would have an extremely high Q</strong>. A musical created by a team of strangers would have a low Q.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uzzi then tallied his Q readings with information about how successful the productions had been. “Frankly, I was surprised by how big the effect was,” Uzzi told me. “I expected Q to matter, but I had no idea it would matter this much.” According to the data, the <strong>relationships among collaborators emerged as a reliable predictor of Broadway success.</strong> When the Q was low—less than 1.7 on Uzzi’s five-point scale—the musicals were likely to fail. Because the artists didn’t know one another, they struggled to work together and exchange ideas. “This wasn’t so surprising,” Uzzi says. “It takes time to develop a successful collaboration.” <strong>But, when the Q was too high (above 3.2), the work also suffered.</strong> The artists all thought in similar ways, which crushed innovation. According to Uzzi, this is what happened on Broadway during the nineteen-twenties, which he made the focus of a separate study. The decade is remembered for its glittering array of talent—Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II, and so on—but Uzzi’s data reveals that ninety per cent of musicals produced during the decade were flops, far above the historical norm. “Broadway had some of the biggest names ever,” Uzzi explains. “But the shows were too full of repeat relationships, and that stifled creativity.”</p>
<p><strong>The best Broadway shows were produced by networks with an intermediate level of social intimacy.</strong> The ideal level of Q—which Uzzi and his colleague Jarrett Spiro called the <strong>“bliss point”—emerged as being between 2.4 and 2.6.</strong> A show produced by a team whose Q was within this range was three times more likely to be a commercial success than a musical produced by a team with a score below 1.4 or above 3.2. It was also three times more likely to be lauded by the critics. “The best Broadway teams, by far, were those with a mix of relationships,” Uzzi says. “These teams had some old friends, but they also had newbies. This mixture meant that the artists could interact efficiently—they had a familiar structure to fall back on—but they also managed to incorporate some new ideas. They were comfortable with each other, but they weren’t too comfortable.”</p>
<p>Uzzi’s favorite example of “intermediate Q” is “West Side Story,” one of the most successful Broadway musicals ever. In 1957, the play was seen as a radical departure from Broadway conventions, both for its focus on social problems and for its extended dance scenes. The concept was dreamed up by Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, and Arthur Laurents. They were all Broadway legends, which might make “West Side Story” look like a show with high Q. But the project also benefitted from a crucial injection of unknown talent, as the established artists realized that they needed a fresh lyrical voice. After an extensive search, they chose a twenty-five-year-old lyricist who had never worked on a Broadway musical before. His name was Stephen Sondheim.</p>

<p>Amazon is a great company. So is Apple. Although they both have content, ie iTune vs. Amazon, or tablet device, iPad vs. Kindle. the two companies culture are dramatically different.  Their strategy to profit are different.</p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Twitter-_-alexdong_-Apple_s-goal-is-to-make-....jpg"><img alt="" src="http://alexdong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Twitter-_-alexdong_-Apple_s-goal-is-to-make-....jpg"></a></p>
<p>Daring Fireball's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/amazons_play">Amazon's Play </a>has summarized most of what I wanted to say about this. So I'll just quote him out right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s goal is to sell as many iPads as it can. <strong>Amazon’s goal is to sell as many Kindle Fires as it can to a specific audience: active Amazon.com customers.</strong> And for that specific audience, it’s a very appealing proposition. The <strong>Fire makes it even easier to do things you’re already doing</strong> — reading Kindle e-books, watching movies and TV shows through your Prime membership. And the low prices speak to the heart of the Amazon.com customer base. When Bezos says he wants Amazon’s interests aligned with those of their customers, he means it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s a <em>heads we win, tails you lose</em> strategy.</strong> That’s the brilliance. If you buy an iPad but use Amazon’s iOS apps to read Kindle books and watch movies through your Amazon Prime account, Apple wins but so too does Amazon. If you buy a Kindle Fire instead of an iPad, Apple gets nothing. Amazon wins so long as you consume media content from Amazon, no matter if you play it on a Kindle Fire or an iPad. Apple only wins if you buy an iPad.</p>
<p>ReadWriteWeb has one chart that shows the huge d<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the-difference-between-apple-amazon-in-one-chart.php">ifference Between Apple &amp; Amazon In One Chart</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/files/styles/610_0/public/fields/apple-amazon-profit-chart.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, if short-term profit is all that matters, Apple is winning by a mile. Apple has generated more than $73 billion of profit over the span of this chart, while Amazon is around $2 billion. Some of that has to do with the relative size of the companies; Apple is about three times bigger, sales-wise. But Apple's approach is still dramatically more profitable on a relative basis.</p>
<p>That said, there's also merit to Amazon's approach. By pricing its devices lower, it's potentially bringing its technologies to more people in different economic positions. Apple has lowered its pricing premium significantly over the years, but there are still potentially millions of people who could justify buying a $200 Kindle Fire but not a $400 iPad. Apple is now expected to launch a smaller, cheaper iPad, something it once suggested it wouldn't do - an action attributable in part to Amazon's success.</p>
<p>Will Amazon's approach ever lead to substantial profits? If Apple and Google are driving media and app prices lower, that leaves less room for Amazon to profit in the future. But Amazon is a multifaceted machine, ranging from digital media sales to paper-towel delivery. It's possible that getting customers all-in on Amazon's digital and Prime services will eventually lead to greater profits across the board.</p>
