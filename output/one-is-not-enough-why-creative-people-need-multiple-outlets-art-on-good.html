<p>I still don't know what I want to build next.  But I do know that to make the people happy, especially the ones with tons of raw creativities, we'll have to provide a structure that provides, instead of kills, more than one outlets.</p>
<p>The kind of employment agreement where one can't do anything except work related tasks scares the shit out of me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creativity in any form is healthy, as study after study has shown. Designing magazines and drawing on every surface imaginable has helped define who I am and my understanding of the world—and allows me to inform that world, shape it, and make it something imaginative and delightful. Finding a secondary creative outlet would allow my creativity, not my craft, to define me. In the meantime, it's nice to know I can drag a crayon across the page and feel like it’s all going to be ok.</p>
