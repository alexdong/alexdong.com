      <p>Life is fuzzy and poetic. </p>
<p>Numbers are clean and precise.  </p>
<p>We should develop the muscle to appreciate both. After all, we are born
with a right brain for intuition and a left brain for logic thinking.
Why should we only use one? Why should we pit one against the other.

<p>I'm a big fan of modeling and I believe that the process of building a
model helps us to gain much clarity into a topic. It gives us a sense of
agency. Instead of feeling powerless and at the mercy of a giant random
number generator in the sky, a good model helps us to understand our
world better so we know where our time and effort will give the best
return.</p>
