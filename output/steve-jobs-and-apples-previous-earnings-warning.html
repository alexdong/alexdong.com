      <p>Just like the previous two days, I'm handcopying a piece of writing today. </p>
<p>This one is a letter from Steve Jobs. It's so tightly crafted that it's almost beautiful.  (Source: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/steve_jobs_and_apples_last_previous_earnings_warning">Daring
fireball</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple today announced that it expects to generate revenues of about
$1.4 billion to $1.45 billion in the June quarter, down from previous
guidance of about $1.6 billion. The lower-than-expected revenues are
primarily due to soft demand in the consumer and creative markets
such as advertising and publishing. Geographically, revenue shortfall
is expected to be offset significantly by higher-than-expected gross
margins primarily due to lower costs of some components. Accordingly,
the Company has revised its earnings guidance from $.08 to $.10 per
diluted share, compared to previous guidance of $.11 or slightly
higher.</p>
<p>"Like others in our industry, we are experiencing a slowdown in sales
this quarter. As a result, we're going to miss our revenue
projections by around 10%, resulting in slightly lower profits," said
Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "We've got some amazing new products in
development, so we're excited about the year ahead. As one of the few
companies currently making a profit in the PC business, we remain
very optimistic about Apple's prospects for long-term growth".</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is John Gruber's commentary on the writing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the tight construction of that message from Apple in 2002.
First paragraph: put out the numbers. Second paragraph: it’s an
industry-wide problem, but Apple has “amazing new products” coming.
And then the kicker, the dagger: “As one of the few companies
currently making a profit in the PC business…”.</p>
<p>We’ve got some short term bad news but don’t worry, we have this.”
And… out. Short and sweet. Rip off the bad news Band-Aid, express
quiet confidence that Apple is in great shape, and that’s it. Message
over.</p>
