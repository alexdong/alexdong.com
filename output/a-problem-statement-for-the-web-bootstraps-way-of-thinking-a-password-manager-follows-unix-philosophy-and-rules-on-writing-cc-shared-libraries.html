<p><a href="http://unitscale.com/mb/bomb-in-the-garden/">The bomb in the garden</a>: <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/end-credits.html#bio">Matthew Butterick</a>'s summarization on the problems of the Internet. It helps me to tie a few thoughts together into a more coherent framework.  The problem statement:"the web is much better at making information free than making it expensive".  As a consequence, "We've ended up with a web dominated by advertising, which is weakening. ". We're seeing "a gradual degradation of design quality" and the real possibility of "the open web becomes a second-class platform".  He did propose a solution, which is similar to what Tim Berners Lee <a href="http://www.weforum.org/videos/insight-idea-tim-berners-lee">said</a> at World Economic Forum in Jan, that we need to make it really easy to pay for online content.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.helloerik.com/bootstrap-3-grid-introduction">Bootstrap 3 Grid Introduction</a>: I found bootstrap v3's "mobile first" approach a bit confusing. This article provides a short-but-solid description on what does it mean to be a "mobile first" grid system.  Even if you were not using bootstrap v3, reading this would still bring a new perspective to stylesheet design in mobile age. </p>
<p><a href="http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/">Pass: the standard Unix password manager</a>: A great password manager that follows the Unix philosophy. It uses GPG to encrypt password files and uses git to track password changes. </p>
<p><a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/8/18/beautiful-native-libraries/">Beautiful Native Libraries</a>: Armin's suggestions on writing proper c/c++ shared libraries that "do not annoy your users". Loads of solid advises, but I hope I would never need to use them. </p>
