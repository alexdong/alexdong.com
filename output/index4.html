<blockquote>
<p>My love of Android lies heavily with the way Android handles notifications. These aren't your useless "read-only" iOS notifications that just launch the app. I've thought about notifications a lot while I working on the (twitter's) notifications team; how to keep the user in control and make it clear what each notification is actually saying.</p>

<p>I did not premeditate anything. I just winged it, and when I saw problems I triaged them. The Slashdot system was very much evolved and not designed.   One thing I learned is don’t spend your entire life playing predictive defense against attacks that will never happen. Real people are very clever. If they choose to attack you they’ll attack you in ways you can’t predict.
Most people are just purely passive consumers, and that’s okay. I think a lot of people in this space obsess too much over trying to convert passives into actives. Some people are just wired to be that kind of person. Others aren’t. That’s okay.
With more and more voices, you tend toward broader subjects. Eventually it becomes less and less interesting. But what’s interesting to [me] isn’t always the thing that’s most lucrative. I had a pretty strong belief that the population of Slashdot users was relatively fixed. That makes for a crappy business model. You want to have a million really good users and be done? How does make the chart go up and to the right?</p>

Research firm InfoTrends did a survey of Internet connected households in EU, and photo printing went up 11% in 2012 compared to 2007-2008. Similarly, U.S.-based online photo printing has become a big deal, growing by about 20% annually between 2007-2012 according to market research firm IbisWorld. Three significant reasons for this growth are: the adoption of digital cameras, ability to transport photos online, and the increase in broadband and mobile Internet connections.

<p>Launched in September 2008, the Ann Arbor Chronicle is an online newspaper that focuses on civic affairs and local government coverage. Although we’d likely be classified by most folks as “new media,” in many ways we embrace an ethos that runs contrary to current trends: Longer, in-depth articles; an emphasis on factual accuracy and thoroughness, not speed; and an assumption that our readers are thoughtful, intelligent and engaged in this community.</p>

It's messy. It's ugly. It has layers and layers of patches yet everytime you feel it has hit a wall, a project like <a href="http://asmjs.org">asm.js</a> will come and lift it into stratosphere. 
Sometimes I do hope that WebOS would make it to the end if the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem">webkit issues were that easy to solve</a>. I sincerely wish FireFox and Mozilaa best luck in breaking up the walled gardens. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Asm.js is reasonably competitive with native C++ code on ARM. Even discarding the one score where asm.js did better, it executes at around 70% of the speed of native C++ code. These results suggest that apps with high performance needs can use asm.js as the target of choice for critical hot-path code, achieving near native performance.</li>
<li>Asm.js competes very well on mobile performance compared to Dalvik. Even throwing out the benchmarks that are highly favourable to asm.js (binary-trees and fasta), there seems to be a consistent 10-50% speedup over comparable Dalvik code.</li>

Your adversaries might not have your private key today, but what they can do now is record all your encrypted traffic. Eventually, they might obtain the key in one way or another (e.g., by bribing someone, obtaining a warrant, or by breaking the key after sufficient technology advances) and, at that time, they will be able to go back in time to decrypt everything.

photography technique</a>. 
Here are the main ideas from "art school's true exercises": </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Take n pictures of a single object, making sure that no two were the same (n was generally some large number like '100' or '250') - 
   The exercise was designed to train yourself to begin to see the many ways it's possible to approach a subject...</li>
<li>Find an object and take the exact same picture of it every hour for 24 hours (generally an inanimate object... ) - 
   The goal was to see how even something that doesn't move changes quite radically depending on what is going on around it.</li>
<li>Take 100 pictures of objects that have a common characteristic (they're all buildings, they're all less than 1 inch wide, 
   they're all blue, etc.) - The goal was to learn how to find interesting pictures 'hiding inside' everyday objects.</li>
<li>Take 100 pictures from a perspective you wouldn't normally think to take pictures from (lying down, under water, 
   upside down, cropped to 1x6, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think these four steps could be mapped to the similar process in learning and mastering the art of programming, ie 
learning your tool, understand the context, form your own opinion and open up to new ideas. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of movies, near the end of the hit film "Catch Me If You Can," there's a scene that Snowden might do well to watch while he's killing time in the airport lounge (or wherever he is) pondering his fate. The young forger, Frank Abagnale, who has been staying a step ahead of the feds, finally grows irritated and fatigued. Not because they are particularly skilled in their hunting, nor because they are getting closer, but simply because they won't give up. In a fit of pique, he blurts into the phone, "Stop chasing me!" On the other end, the dogged, bureaucratic Treasury agent, Carl Hanratty, answers, "I can't stop. It's my job."
Ultimately, this is why many people who have been involved in such matters believe Snowden will be caught.  ...
They'll have to make Edward Snowden their living, because those who are chasing him already have. Government agents will be paid every minute of every day for as long as it takes. Seasons may change and years may pass, but the odds say that one morning, he'll look out of a window, go for a walk or stop for a cup of coffee, and the trap will spring shut. It will be almost like a movie.</p>

<p>For the last two weeks, I've been working on an audit project for an Android app. 
I worked on Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE">WinCE</a> about 14 years ago. 
I am quietly impressed by how developer friendly the Android platform is. Here are a couple of
shell scripts I have written to make the reverse engineering process easier. </p>
<p>During our work, it is quite common to make some modification to the smali files 
generated by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/">apktool</a>, turn it back 
into a proper apk and install on the device to see whether our guesses were correct. 
This is quite a repetitive process that involves sign the apk, align the zip file, 
uninstall the original app and install the new one from local computer to the device. </p>
<p><code>Pack.sh</code> is a shell script that automates this process for you. It takes two parameters, 
the first is the folder where the smali files are; the second is the package name 
for the application, which is needed for us to automatically uninstalled the app from 
the device. </p>
<p>{% gist 6073781 %}</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a> is a brilliant tool that allows you to 
attach to a running process and see all the unix system calls it's making. 
Once you get it up and running, it is almost trivial to get a comprehensive view 
of the app's interaction with Android system, for example, 
which files it touches, which urls it requests. </p>
<p>In our case, the app would be launched and crashed immediately, leaving us no time
to manually attach a strace to the process to see what has gone wrong. <code>ambush.sh</code>
is a shell script that waits for a process to show up and automatically attach strace
to that process. This makes it possible for us to see what the app has been doing 
before it crashes itself. It takes two parameters too. The first is the pattern 
that <code>ps | grep</code> could use to find the process id; the latter is where the strace
is located. </p>

<p>In its desire for authenticity, the Modern design movement curbed the ornamental excess of the 19th century, making design fit the age of mass production. </p>
<p>(In late 19 century) The idea was to highlight beauty of form in objects that were purely functional. For the modern design movement, decoration was not necessary. Beauty and elegance were to emerge from the design of the content itself, not from a superficial coat of decoration.</p>
<p>Authentic design is about using materials without masking them in fake textures, showcasing their strengths instead of trying to hide their weaknesses. Authentic design is about doing away with features that are included only to make a product appear familiar or desirable but that otherwise serve no purpose.</p>
<p>"Its artless shape gave it a certain naive innocence that suggested authenticity, just as the early versions of the Land Rover had the kind of credibility that comes with a design based on a technically ingenious idea rather than the desire to create a seductive consumer product." --  Deyan Sudjic commented on the design of the iconic Anglepoise lamp</p>
<p>Design whose beauty lies in function is not the same thing as minimalist style. With the former, the designer seeks to remove the superfluous, to make the product easier to understand, to make it perform better and to make the most of its medium. The latter seeks to create a minimalist aesthetic, to give the object an aura of simplicity and cleanliness. One is a fundamental principle of design, the other a stylistic choice.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to rigidly apply a minimalist design aesthetic to an interface as a style in the hope of making the interface simpler and more digitally “authentic.” For example, ruthlessly eliminating visuals such as shadows, colors and varied background styles would not necessarily make an interface easier to use. In some cases, it would achieve the opposite by undermining hierarchy and focus, which were established by those very shadows and background colors.</p>

You just modify a file and you're done. But with that flexibility comes with huge security risks. In fact the security holes in PHP has scared me away from wordpress into Jekyll.  This backdoor is possible because this strange decision to make a string replace be able to execute a file. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>preg_replace has a hidden and tricky option where if you pass the “/e” modifier it will execute the content (eval), instead of just searching/replacing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we do hit peak smart phone penetration, how might the app store dynamics change? It’s hard to know before it happens but here are a few thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited demand for applications should increase the average cost per install. This will drive developers to pursue apps with increasing monetization to support higher costs of acquisition.</li>
<li>We will have maturity in utility categories like email clients, phone clients, web browsers; some turnover in social networks; most turnover in games. Utilities tend to be downloaded by new users and infrequently replaced. But gamers swap out the next platformer as soon as they are bored.</li>
<li>Decreasing attractiveness of the marginal smart phone user in terms of ARPUU. New smart phone users will increasingly live outside of the most developed markets.</li>
