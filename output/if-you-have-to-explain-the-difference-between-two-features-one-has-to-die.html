<p>Yup. I mean it. If you have two functions on your website and your fellow co-worker asked you "which one shall I use to do task X" and you have to explain to them "A is for this and B is similar but it does this.". It's time to kill one feature. It's just that simple. It's also one design principle you can hear me constantly speaking in work.</p>
<p>Design, by its nature, is like editing an article. If you have two paragraphs saying pretty much the same thing, will you keep both of them. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of square and Chairman of Twitter basically said "<a href="https://twitter.com/hash/status/84417208385683456">CEO is the Editor of the product, the team and the story</a>".</p>

<p>This is another video from Jack on The CEO as Chief Editor.</p>
