<p><strong>“What’s the definition of happiness?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily he has an answer and it’s a good one: <strong>“Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it”. </strong></p>
<p>This then is Principle Two for the successful optimist. All successful optimists have a project that is bigger than they are. By contrast, people who have a project that is the same size as themselves are invariably miserable and tedious company. Once you’ve got a bigger car/ nicer house/ television bigger than God what’s left? As so many find out, eventually the answer is a nagging emptiness accompanied by the thought, “Surely there must be more to life than this?”</p>
<p>Those with something bigger than themselves generally derive a deep-in-the-core happiness from whatever that is.<strong> It’s a happiness that comes from a feeling you have a place in the world.</strong> A ‘bigger than me’ project can be your family, your religion, military service or a scientific calling. You don’t have to agree with another person’s ‘bigger than me’ project but it is true that people who have them are usually more driven, positive and able to get things done as a result. This is a happiness different from the passing pleasures of a good night out or great joke, and it will not manifest itself as merriment, but its motivating power is fundamental to the successful optimist.</p>

<p>I still don't know what I want to build next.  But I do know that to make the people happy, especially the ones with tons of raw creativities, we'll have to provide a structure that provides, instead of kills, more than one outlets.</p>
<p>The kind of employment agreement where one can't do anything except work related tasks scares the shit out of me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creativity in any form is healthy, as study after study has shown. Designing magazines and drawing on every surface imaginable has helped define who I am and my understanding of the world—and allows me to inform that world, shape it, and make it something imaginative and delightful. Finding a secondary creative outlet would allow my creativity, not my craft, to define me. In the meantime, it's nice to know I can drag a crayon across the page and feel like it’s all going to be ok.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Today is my last day at Avos.</p>
<p>I'm feeling very grateful about this experience. I have learned so much in the past 14 months that I can't believe it's only a little more than 1 year.  This is my first "job" working out of mainland China, in a pure western culture. Also my first job working in the consumer internet space.   I'm sure that as the time goes by, the memory will become fuzzier.  So while the scenes are still fresh, I'd like to list what I have learned from all the outstanding people in Avos.  As my own way to say thank you and wave good bye to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Josh:  Remain calm and cool when some unexpected problem happens. Josh showed me what a truly talented engineer would be.  It's less about how much you know but how you can get the problem solved using the tools on hand.  I have always considered myself a good engineer but Josh made me realise that I'm too emotional to keep my brain always cool and logic.  Josh makes me feel I'm more an artist than an engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alan: Been professional means high performance no matter how you are treated.  I cherish the night when Alan, Israel and me walked back from office to hotel when we were in San Francisco. I've been consistently stunned by how hard and consistent Alan works no matter how much mis-understanding there have been.  He never seems to care whose fault it is. He just gets there and tries to get things sorted.  He also taught me again and again that "form follows function".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gerwin: A team needs colour. Also what a young talent can learn and do in such a short period of time.  I love to tease Gerwin at work. I actually like to hear him cursing. It reminds me of my college years where I cursed like a sailor.  I think Gerwin brings colour and a bit spicy to an otherwise boring and too serious engineering team. Making us a better team really.   Besides that, his young age and how much he knows about javascript/css is clearly telling me that the web-native generation has grown up. Gerwin, you always makes me feel old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ben:  Reliable, quiet and he-speaks-and-people-listen. I totally under-estimated Ben at the beginning.  You see, we value what we know.  Ben is this quiet, shy guy who seldom speaks. But as we collaborate side-by-side for the last a few months, I get to appreciate how he works. He is almost totally opposite from who I am. Hence making him a perfect work to work with.  Every morning, if I open up the mail and notice the bug reports, I would close it right away. I get bored checking system status dashboard everyday.  Yet Ben would happily pour his morning coffee and quietly squashed all the bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BH:  Myself 12 years ago. I like BH because I always looked at him and thought to myself: wow, I did the exact same thing 12 years ago.  We always value talents, passion and energy. We under-value consistency, professional and maturity. But as I work with BH through the up and down, sitting in downtown San Francisco's hotel and listen to his rants, I found myself just loving him for all the youth idealism and energy. So pure and untainted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Israel: The importance of knowing one's strength/weakness well. Israel have had a rough trip. He was assigned to the roles that were needed but didn't suit him.  Israel also keeps on reminding me how much a job means to a family.  For every job position, there is actually a whole family's happiness associated with it. There is his beautiful wife waiting at home. There are his two young boys asking where Dad is. I will not handle job positions lightly just because of this. People are not switchable widgets. They have emotions and families.  They deserve to be treated with respect and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steve: How leader works. I do not agree with Steve on all things but I'd say most of the times, I am quietly impressed by how laser focused he is on the product.  I learned the value of being firm about an idea and push through to get a vision implemented instead of trying to convince everyone.  I am also on the receiver end to know how productive and happy I was when I had the trust and freedom to operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tim: Every engineering team needs a Tim. I've been working with Tim back in the old trunk.ly days but the past 14 months has shown the immense value of having a "tim" on the team.  To tight the loose ends and keep the whole team rowing towards the same direction.  I learn again and again from Tim the value of perform consistently no matter one gets the attention or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also others I have had the luck to work with that's not mentioned here, especially Andy, Lucy, Cheng, Vijay, Walter, Brent, Doug, Matt, George and Sara. I've also learned heaps from you folks.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Most of my respected entrepreneurs are the ones who <a href="http://alexdong.com/fundamentally-unemployable/">dare to be different</a>. Who stands on their own rights and push the boundaries. Like the <a href="https://medium.com/20/93b9168703d6">giant tree. </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A carpenter and his apprentices were travelling through the province of Qi in search of building materials.
They saw a giant tree; five men all holding hands could not encompass its girth, and its crown reached almost to the clouds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Let’s not waste our time with this tree,’ said the master carpenter. ‘It would take us for ever to cut it down. If we wanted to make a ship out of that heavy trunk, the ship would sink. If we tried to use it to build a roof, the walls would have to be specially reinforced.’</p>
<p>The group continued on its way. One of the apprentices remarked:</p>
<p>‘Such a big tree and no use to anyone!’</p>
<p>‘That’s where you’re wrong,’ said the master carpenter. ‘The tree was true to its own destiny.
“If it had been like all the others, we would have cut it down. But because it had the courage to be different, it will remain alive and strong for a long time yet.</p>

<p>The more I learn about Israel and its culture, the more I like it.</p>
<p>One concrete example is this kind of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ilan-abehassera">optimism</a> after a total unfair treatment from a company whose motto is "Don't be Evil".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the interesting part. On my last day at Zlio, I had a long discussion with Jeremie, and despite the bad times, Jeremie was still very optimistic and even relieved I would say. Why? He told me his life’s theory, and it’s based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</a> principle that I’ve been following ever since, and that has changed my life (yes really).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In hebrew we say “<a href="http://www.neveh.org/price/price2.html">Gam Zou Letova</a>”, that could be translated by : “Everything that happens in your life is for your own good”, or, “Every challenge makes you stronger”. You get the idea.</p>
<p>When Jeremie explained it to me, I had a hard time understanding this optimistic principle in such hard times in his professional life. All he said was, don’t worry, good things will happen after this tough experience.</p>
<p>This is the story about the screw-over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the little story, Zlio, became blacklisted/sandboxed by Google 6 months after…. It killed the company…</p>
