      <p>Within Amazon, powerpoint presentations are never used in meetings.
Instead, employees are required to write six-page narratives laying out
their points in prose and "staff meetings at Amazon begin with 30
minutes of silent reading". This is so strange that I decided to find
out more about it, with the end goal of seeing whether we should apply
this practice in our business.  </p>
<p>First, the benefits.</p>
<p>Benefit #1: Provide more context. The story-telling narrative helps to
tie all the numbers and analysis into a coherent story, providing an
opportunity to review the core data going into a decision and share the
process that leads to the final decision. </p>
<p>Benefit #2: Accelerate knowledge sharing. A collection of these
well-written documents enable everyone in the company to internalise a
whole new space within 30 minutes of reading. Greatly optimising how
quickly and how many different initiatives the team can work on in
parallel. </p>
<p>Benefit #3: Encourage learning. The writings established the records for
future clinical examination and instituionalised proprietary learning.
When the final result is out, it'd be much easier to review and
hopefully learn from it by comparing the written records to what
actually happened.</p>
<p>Ok now the key pieces ...</p>
<p>Component #1: writing in narrative. Writing is more honest. It's harder
to hide half-thought-out arguments in clear, concise and coherent
writing.  According to Bezos: "When you have to write your ideas out in
complete sentences, complete paragraphs it forces a deeper clarity."
Andy Grove considered written reports vital because “the author is
forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.”</p>
<p>As for the story-telling narrative, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/386e57b2-52a9-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec">Bezos said</a> : "We
have so many metrics . . . and the thing I have noticed is that when the
anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.
There’s something wrong with the way you’re measuring." He believes in
telling a story vividly, rather than relying on data or graphics. (Have
you read of his <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm">handstand
story</a>
in his letter to shareholder?)</p>
<p>Component #2: six page limit. Precision counts. It requires a lot of
work for the team to deeply understand their own space, gather the data,
understand the operating tenets and be able to communicate all these
clearly. The Amazon team member often rewrite the memo several times to
make the writing "interesting and easy to read" before presenting to the
senior team. </p>
<p>As for the data, the validation, the information that feeds into the
narrative that doesn't carry the structure, they go into the appendixes
for completeness and cross reference.</p>
<p>Component #3: silent reading session. This is the weirdest meeting I'd
imagine. When asked "Why don't you read the memos in advance?" Bezos
replied "Time doesn't come from nowhere.  This way you know everyone has
the time. The author gets the nice warm feeling of seeing their hard
work being read." </p>
<p>Here is a recommendation on how to structure a six-pager. FWIW, it's a
reasonable starting point that I'd try to base my 2019 annual plans on.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the past it was like this …</li>
<li>Then something happened …</li>
<li>So now we should do this …</li>
<li>So the future might be like this …</li>
</ol>
