        <p>Just like the previous two days, I'm handcopying a piece of writing today. </p>
<p>This one is a letter from Steve Jobs. It's so tightly crafted that it's almost beautiful.  (Source: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/steve_jobs_and_apples_last_previous_earnings_warning">Daring
fireball</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple today announced that it expects to generate revenues of about
$1.4 billion to $1.45 billion in the June quarter, down from previous
guidance of about $1.6 billion. The lower-than-expected revenues are
primarily due to soft demand in the consumer and creative markets
such as advertising and publishing. Geographically, revenue shortfall
is expected to be offset significantly by higher-than-expected gross
margins primarily due to lower costs of some components. Accordingly,
the Company has revised its earnings guidance from $.08 to $.10 per
diluted share, compared to previous guidance of $.11 or slightly
higher.</p>
<p>"Like others in our industry, we are experiencing a slowdown in sales
this quarter. As a result, we're going to miss our revenue
projections by around 10%, resulting in slightly lower profits," said
Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "We've got some amazing new products in
development, so we're excited about the year ahead. As one of the few
companies currently making a profit in the PC business, we remain
very optimistic about Apple's prospects for long-term growth".</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is John Gruber's commentary on the writing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the tight construction of that message from Apple in 2002.
First paragraph: put out the numbers. Second paragraph: it’s an
industry-wide problem, but Apple has “amazing new products” coming.
And then the kicker, the dagger: “As one of the few companies
currently making a profit in the PC business…”.</p>
<p>We’ve got some short term bad news but don’t worry, we have this.”
And… out. Short and sweet. Rip off the bad news Band-Aid, express
quiet confidence that Apple is in great shape, and that’s it. Message
over.</p>

        <p>Another day. Another tweetstorm. This time by
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936">@naval</a>:</p>
<p>Just like yesterday, I'm handcopying the full thread here as a way to
appreciate and understand it better. </p>
<p>Key concepts: specific knowledge (proprietary knowledge is what I prefer
to call it), leverage, accountability, and judgement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn
   while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is
   your place in the social hierarchy.</li>
<li>Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly
   despise wealth, it will elude you.</li>
<li>Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking
   people playing wealth creation games.</li>
<li>You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own
   equity --- a piece of a business --- to gain your financial freedom.</li>
<li>You'll get rich by <a href="/platform-wins-by-turning-everyone-into-commodity-sellers.html">giving society what it wants but does not yet know
   how to get. At scale.</a> </li>
<li>Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term
   people.</li>
<li>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.
   Most people haven't figured this out yet.</li>
<li>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth,
   relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</li>
<li>Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above
   all, integrity.</li>
<li>Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are
    self-fulfilling.</li>
<li>Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be
    unstoppable.</li>
<li>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and
    <a href="/hello-2019.html">leverage</a></li>
<li>Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If
    society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.</li>
<li>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and
    passion rather than whatever is hot right now.</li>
<li>Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look
    like work to others.</li>
<li>When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not
    schools.</li>
<li>Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot
    be outsourced or automated.</li>
<li>Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.
    Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.</li>
<li>The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands:
    Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. (AD: Trump? Really?)</li>
<li>"Give me a leverl long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move
    the earth." - Archimedes.</li>
<li>Fortune require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital,
    people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and
    media).</li>
<li>Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge,
    with accountability, and show resulting good judgement.</li>
<li>Labour means people working for you. It's the oldest and most
    fought-over form of leverage. Labour leverage will impress your
    parents, but don't waste your life chasing it.</li>
<li>Capital and labour are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing
    capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to
    lead, but someone has to follow you.</li>
<li>Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage
    behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works
    for you while you sleep.</li>
<li>An army of robots is freely available --- it's just packed in data
    centres for heat and space efficiency. Use it.</li>
<li>If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and
    podcasts. </li>
<li>Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.</li>
<li>Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning
    foundational skills.</li>
<li>There is no skill called "business". Avoid business magazines and
    business classes.</li>
<li>Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics,
    mathematics, and computers.</li>
<li>Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
    (AD: what the hell does this mean? Spend less time socialising and
    more time reading? Just do it mentality?)</li>
<li>You should be too busy to "do coffee", while still keeping an
    uncluttered calendar. </li>
<li>Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a
    problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If
    outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource
    it.</li>
<li>Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you
    work on are more important than how hard you work. </li>
<li>Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep refining what you
    do until this is true.</li>
<li>There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else
    getting rich off you. </li>
<li>Apply specific knowledge, with leverage and good judgement, and
    eventually you will get what you deserve. </li>
<li>When you're finally wealthy, you'll realise that it wasn't what you
    were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day. (AD:
    This is pretty fruastrating way to end a thoughtful thread. )</li>

        <p>This full thread is from
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/stevesi/status/1081174886901473280">@stevesi</a>. 
Steven Sinofsky is one of the best strategic thinkers and this thread
talks about the topics I blogged <a href="/platform-wins-by-turning-everyone-into-commodity-sellers.html">yesterday</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the typical way for a luxury brand to broaden its appearl. </li>
<li>How does a platform make money?</li>
<li>How does players on a platform make their money? </li>
<li>How has Apple avoided been bogged down by the partners?</li>
</ol>
<p>(I'm re-typing everything again so I get to appreciate his points
better.  Steven, or twitter, owns his tweets. Not me. )</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple has long known it is missing the boat on providing low priced
   phones --- strategic mistake to cede "low end" to Android. Or raised
   prices too much/soon. Then it must be an easy answer to just lower
   prices or make low priced phones. Ack! Harder than it looks.</li>
<li>Pricing is much more sophisticated than this. Pricing not only says
   who can afford your product but also establishes a brand, determines
   channel &amp; more.  Many say Apple is a luxury brand; certainly they
   focused on that.</li>
<li>PC v Mac really showed the weakness in appealing to luxury brand in a
   volume driven market. High prices were the undoing of the Mac  from
   the very early days. 
   Going back to 1990, height of Apple, PCs sold at 10X the Mac run
   rate. But Macs had much higher margins per device.</li>
<li>While available software was a big part of that 10X, reality was that
   a Mac computer also cost substantially more than a PC, and depending
   on configuration was often 2X the price.
   Everyone knew. Apple/Jobs refused to license Mac System enabling
   cheaper Macs (one approach).</li>
<li>PC strategy was low everyday prices for PCs. BUT there was a catch or
   three --- really important to think about relative to iPhones
   pricing.
   PCs were made up of hardware, OS, chips. To have low prices Intel and
   Microsoft benefited from an ecosystem that "raced to the bottom".</li>
<li>Intel and Microsoft held on to most of the profits in selling PCs
   (and MS w/Office). The retailers and PC makers had very slim (to
   zero) margins for two decades. Often PC hardware seemed like a
   suckers bet.</li>
<li>The first key to having low priced offerings is that you have to have
   a set of partners who are willing to compete on thin margins in order
   to bring the product to market. 
   Very tough for one player to be the high margin and low margin
   players. Race yourself to the bottom?</li>
<li>The second key thing PCs benefitted from was a channel that allowed
   distribution by price maintaining price walls - business PCs could be
   expensive/sold direct (ThinkPad); consumer PCs sold as a bundles with
   high margin components useless as business PCs. (Dell's Inspiron and
   Optiplex etc.)</li>
<li>Buying a PC was a complex navigation through model line selected by
   segment (Big Business direct, SMB, individual, Education,
   Government). Then each form factor was "good, better, best".
   Byzantine. That's how you offer low prices and avoid everyone paying
   and have some margin.</li>
<li>Plus that is where crapware comes from --- those partners need some
    way to make margin. Adding software, selling screen real-estate, and
    so on are the only tools remain that allow for partners to make
    something when hardware and OS are fixed. </li>
<li>This is how business always does premium+low priced offers, eg
    clothing where brands stand for luxury but aspire to mass market.
    Brands like Calvin Klein, Ralph Laruen, Armani w/ topi tier labels
    (like Purple) at select channels or direct. BUT also have mass
    market/discount.</li>
<li>Each of those distribution points is a different label, different
    quality, and so on. No retailer that carries Purple will carry Sport
    or RL. They might want to but they won't be allowed to ---
    distribution constraint that is carefully managed.</li>
<li>So when people say Apple needs a cheaper phone there are many
    questions to answer beyond the "get over yourself" luxury brand
    issue.
    What is distribution constraint? What partner absorbs some cost to
    leave margin? What is the branding? </li>
<li>Easy question --- would a cheap phone be sold and supported in Apple
    stores side by side? How would the rest of the customers feel about
    more crowds and tougher appointments competing with people who paid
    half as much? Sell one phone against another --- how? </li>
<li>This doesn't even have to be a product question which most people
    jump to --- sure remove fancy camera, memory, storage,e tc.
    But these are all hardware items that competitive products will
    simply add and market against --- "buy our android phone with
    portrait mode".</li>
<li>Apple is constrained by software because apps need to work on all
    devices --- something that Apple has stretched further than Windows
    ever did (watch to phone to tablet, and soon Mac). ISVs/devs will
    never embrae API differences at different price points. </li>
<li>Consumers bemoan Windows 10 Home, Pro, Enterprise. Insane energy
    goes into trying to have features that don't fragment developers and
    OEMs (drivers, etc) and can be deployed efficiently while alos
    maintaining price differentiation. That's literally the entire
    Windows business. </li>
<li>The levers available to do cheaper products are not all available to
    Apple. Those that simply say they have a pricing problem need to
    solve for the product, the distribution, the branding, and more.</li>
<li>Big companies become <em>enormously</em> consternated over brand value
    props, channel conflicts, and so on. Where Apple avoided all of
    these was owning them all. The downside of owning them all is this
    limits responding to the challenges.</li>
<li>At Microsoft we always reminded ourselves that you don't sell 300M
    of something at one every day low price. Most all energy was to
    maintain price floor. 
    <em>AMAZINGLY</em> Apple managed to sell over 200M of something per year at
    pretty much one every day high price, then increased price.</li>
<li>Anyone that thinks Apple is unaware of the challenge and has not
    sketched out ideas, tested them, and thought about them immensely is
    crazy. Literally this consumes a company or at least has been the
    past year. </li>
<li>Example --- I can't count how many times Windows/Office toyed with
    "lite" versions. Fewer features cost less. DUH! Imaging such product
    and <em>everyone</em> wants it. How do you market it? What brand is it? How
    much revenue do you forgo? Is it freemium? trialware? annoying?</li>
<li>Literally the constant drumbeat from the press, partners, channel
    was that PCs were too expensive, Windows or Office too expensive. No
    matter what the price was. Also Intel hearing the same. Magic for
    Intel/MS was getting others to cave --- who caves for Apple?</li>
<li>I once  ran the numbers on selling just one SKU of Office rather
    than the seemingly infinite number. It was literally billions of
    dollars of lost revenue immediately and more over time --- leaving
    revenue on table PLUS alienating customers at both high end and low
    end. </li>
<li>What does all these mean? Apple may or may not have a "pricing" or
    "price point" or "structural"/secular challenge. For sure just
    releasing a cheap phone doesn't make all better. 
    All takes place in context of lots of cheap/bad competitive phones. 
    Lots to consider.</li>

        <abbr class="published" title="2019-01-03T15:22:00+13:00">
          Published: Thu 03 January 2019
        </abbr>
        <p>The Verge recently ran a featured story on the risks of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">operating in
Amazon's
Marketplace</a>. </p>
<p>Amazon's Marketplace is an e-commerce platform where 6 million sellers
compete against each other to fulfil your orders. Near two third of the
items sold on Amazon are sold by these third-party sellers. </p>
<p>It turns out that some sellers use Amazon's own rules against each
other, devising intricate schemes to get their rivals suspended.  Once
suspended from the platform, sellers find themselves in a bewildering
appeals system. </p>
<p>To quote the story: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have manipulated product reviews on our site,” an email from
Amazon read. “This is against our policies. As a result, you may no
longer sell on Amazon.com, and your listings have been removed from
our site.”</p>
<p>A rival had framed Plansky for buying five-star reviews, a high crime
in the world of Amazon. The funds in his account were immediately
frozen, and his listings were shut down. Getting his store back would
take him on a surreal weeks-long journey through Amazon’s bureaucracy,
one that began with the click of a button at the bottom of his
suspension message that read “appeal decision.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sad situation to find yourself in as a small business
owner. Plansky certainly had my sympathy. But sadly this is to be expected.</p>
<p>I understand that selling through other people's platform saves tons of
money from marketing, giving a young business a headstart at the
beginning. But building one's entire distribution channel on top of
Amazon is willfully ignoring the basic rule at play here.</p>
<p><strong>The platform wins by making everyone else a replaceable commodity.</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two kinds of businesses: value creation
and arbitrage. </p>
<p>Value creation sets out to make a difference, and the primary
way to win is to create something new that people didn't know they want
it. </p>
<p>Arbitrage is to focus on the things people know they want and identify
the suboptimal market opportunities and buy-low-sell-high. </p>
<p>Value creation makes something new and demands a premium. It wins
through exclusivity. Arbitrage removes any inefficiency in the market
and drives the cost down and makes the products available to a broader
audience.</p>
<p>The platforms win by making all sellers play the arbitrage game. It's a
volume based market. It's a race to the bottom" game. Not a value
creation one. As a business owner, it's our responsibility to know which
game we are playing and deal with our hands well.</p>

re-evaluating?</a>:</p>

<p>The former is questioning a decision without material new information.
The latter is revisiting a decision after material new information has
been obtained. It is second guessing which is destructive for morale,
because it calls into question not just the decision but also undermines
the legitimacy of the decision making process itself.</p>
<p>Re-evaluating on the other hand is healthy but requires a good decision
making process. In particular, there has to be a relatively clear way of
assessing whether something is in fact material new information.</p>

<p>Guesstimate is a tool for performing estimates using monte carlo

Eroded trust in institutions and technology, dicey US, messy Brexit and
sluggish China predicates a difficult macro business and political
environment. Technology, riding the transition wave from industry age to
information age, will continue to grow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2018, we saw social media usage in the US flatten out and possibly
even start to decline a bit.And the usage of screen time management
apps, like Screentime on iOS, is surging. We know we are addicted to
tech, we don’t want to be, and we are working on getting sober.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>All of this lost trust is challenging for big tech, and the tech sector
in general, but is also a huge opportunity for new companies and new
technologies that can offer different products and business models that
we can trust more, or don’t need to trust.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This loss of trust in 2018 was not limited to the tech sector. In the
US, and also in many places around the world, we are losing trust in our
institutions and our elected officials.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I expect the combination of higher rates, uncertainty in Washington, and storm clouds globally (which we will get to soon) will cause business leaders in the US to become more cautious on hiring and investment. Consumers will make essentially the same calculations. And that will lead to a weaker economy in the US in 2019.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The startup/tech economy is somewhat immune to macro trends. Many startups and big tech companies were able to grow and expand their businesses during the last financial downturn in 2008 and 2009. Some very important tech companies were even started in those years.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The tech/startup economy is driven first and foremost by technical and creative (ie business model) innovation. And that is not impacted by the macro environment.</p>
<p>So I expect that we will continue to see big tech invest and grow their
businesses and do well in 2019.</p>
<p>However, I do think a difficult macro business and political environment in the US will lead investors to take a more cautious stance in 2019.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But all of that is going to happen at the margin. I expect 2019 to be another solid year for the tech/startup sector as we are in a possibly century-long conversion from an industrial economy to an information economy and the tailwinds for tech/startup vs the rest of the economy remain in place and strong.

Design</a>:
I've never been a big fan of Material design from Google or the Metro
style from Microsoft. Apparently it takes <strong>twice</strong> amount of cognitive
load for people to use these flat design interfaces! Twice!  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past few years flat user interface design has become the
predominating visual style of operating systems, websites and mobile
apps. Although flat design has been widely criticized by HCI and
usability experts, empirical research on flat design is still scarce.
We present the results of an experimental comparative study of visual
search effectiveness on traditional and flat designs. The following
types of visual search tasks were examined: (1) search for a target
word in text; (2) search for a target icon in a matrix of icons; (3)
search for clickable objects on webpages. Time and accuracy parameters
of the visual search, as well as oculomotor activity, were measured.
The results show that a search in flat text mode (compared with the
traditional mode) is associated with higher cognitive load. A search
for flat icons takes twice as long as for realistic icons and is also
characterized by higher cognitive load. Identifying clickable objects
on flat web pages requires more time and is characterised by a
significantly greater number of errors. Our results suggest replacing
the flat style user interfaces with interfaces based on the design
principles developed over decades of research and practice of HCI and
usability engineering. </p>

        <p>Waking up this morning, I felt energised. There was a strong sense of
excitement<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in the air. The kind I felt when I was about to embark on
a new and unknown journey. It was the same excitement when I boarded a
two-day train ride to go to a university that's 2000km away. Or when
Zephyr and I decided to leave China and spend a year travelling when I
turned 30.</p>
<p>I'm energised by the new leverages I have. In 2019, I will have a team
and a modest amount of capital I get to use.  I finally have the
resources to execute the plans.  It'll be so much fun to work closely
with a team again, especially when their experiences and career paths are
so diverse.  The last two years has been a slow burn.  I could see that
I had hit a plateau. I was running at full throttle, but life 
stayed in the same place. The more the business grew,
the more tasks I needed to <em>do</em>, the less concentration time I have, the
less I learned and the less productive I became. It was a
draining experience that I'm glad it's over. </p>
<p>I'm energised by the product I will work on. I have been in and out the
personal photo space for 12 years now. I feel I have learned a
tremendous amount, not only on the technology side of what's possible
but also a deeper understanding of the human emotional needs photo print
products fulfil. With the rest of the business in capable hands, I will
finally have the space to explore the problem domain again and give it
my best shot. To build something I'd be proud of<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>I'm also energised by the opportunities for personal growth. I used to
spend most of my time playing with different technologies and
under-developed my social and interpersonal skills. So in 2019, I'm
looking forward to learning from the amazing people I work with.  Of
their expertise. And how they communicate. I can't wait to read a long
list of books that'll certainly broaden my horizon. And lastly, I am
looking forward to the daily meditation and blog post exercise.</p>
<p>So 2019, here we come.</p>

        <p>Numbers are clean and precise.  </p>
<p>Life is fuzzy and poetic. </p>
<p>We should develop the muscle to appreciate both. After all, we are born
with a left brain for logic and a right brain for intuition.
Why should we only use one?  </p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief that numbers are cold and cruel. I think
numbers give us a sense of agency. Instead of feeling powerless and at
the mercy of a giant random number generator in the sky, a good model
with a few numbers will help us see the world clearer.  As an
individual, we'll know what to do with our energy and our limited life.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of cool examples. Each takes a thorny question with
substantial social and moral implications and comes up with an experiment to
put a definite number on them. I find the designs fascinating and the
numbers revealing some fascinating aspects of the human psyche. I hope you
enjoy them too. </p>
<p>First. How much is Facebook worth to a user? Answer: $1000 per year.
Quoting from the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global
users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are
hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three
non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to
deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the
populations sampled and the auction design differ across the
experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would
require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While
the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on
the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these
services provide for their users are large.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second. Whose life worth more? An infant or a pregnant woman? A dog or a
a criminal?  Tough questions, huh?  Well, there is an
answer to that. Infant. And dog. </p>
<p>Even more interesting is that this is also a global preference, which
means that it's the same across 233 countries and cultures. (Here
is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6/figures/2">a direct
link</a> to
the graph. )</p>
<p>Quoting from the
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6">paper</a> on Nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns
about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of
quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that
should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed
the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore
the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered
40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233
countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this
experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we
document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents’
demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and
uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these
differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits.
We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global,
socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this
article are publicly available.</p>

        <abbr class="published" title="2018-12-29T20:15:00+13:00">
          Published: Sat 29 December 2018

        <p>There are three ways to play the Monopoly game. The bootstrap way, the
well-off way and the real way. </p>
<p>The bootstrap way starts by giving each player $50. All the money needed
for the game mainly comes from the $200 salaries players draw after each
round. The game progresses slowly. Quite often, The players might see a
golden opportunity but don't have the capital to pursue.  Luck played a
significant role but everyone is more or less the same.  Stakes are low
so mistakes aren't lethal.  This is a game of perseverence, best played
with a strong sense of humor when bad luck strikes. </p>
<p>The well-off way begins with a grand total of $2000 or even $5000
<em>inherited</em> for each player. When capital isn't the constraint. The game
moves ahead incredibly fast.  Houses and hotels come up like mushrooms.
Hundreds, if not thousands, dollar changing hands each night in the
hotels. Since the land disappears within the first a few rounds, the
game quickly turns into a strategic play. Negotiation and probability
thinking play far more significant role. The game feels more intense
with lots of social actions.</p>
<p>The real way is the least fun. Every one gets a different amount based
on a lottery. The initial luck determines how much money each player
starts with. If you are lucky, you get $5000; if you are the least
fortunate, you get $50. The bigger the differences are, the less fun the
game is. In fact, the game sucks for everyone. Poor and rich. A bonus
point is that you can design the initial allocation based on a country's
real wealth distribution. For example, play the "New Zealand in 1978"
will give you a totally different feeling compared to "China in 2018". </p>
<p>The bootstrap way is best suited to play with friends on a snow day with
the beef stew in the slow cooker. The well-off way is more fun and
exciting to play with high IQ PE and investment bankers. The real way? I
never managed to see any group finish it.</p>

        <abbr class="published" title="2018-12-28T07:22:00+13:00">
          Published: Fri 28 December 2018

        <p>Within Amazon, powerpoint presentations are never used in meetings.
Instead, employees are required to write six-page narratives laying out
their points in prose and "staff meetings at Amazon begin with 30
minutes of silent reading". This is so strange that I decided to find
out more about it, with the end goal of seeing whether we should apply
this practice in our business.  </p>
<p>First, the benefits.</p>
<p>Benefit #1: Provide more context. The story-telling narrative helps to
tie all the numbers and analysis into a coherent story, providing an
opportunity to review the core data going into a decision and share the
process that leads to the final decision. </p>
<p>Benefit #2: Accelerate knowledge sharing. A collection of these
well-written documents enable everyone in the company to internalise a
whole new space within 30 minutes of reading. Greatly optimising how
quickly and how many different initiatives the team can work on in
parallel. </p>
<p>Benefit #3: Encourage learning. The writings established the records for
future clinical examination and instituionalised proprietary learning.
When the final result is out, it'd be much easier to review and
hopefully learn from it by comparing the written records to what
actually happened.</p>
<p>Ok now the key pieces ...</p>
<p>Component #1: writing in narrative. Writing is more honest. It's harder
to hide half-thought-out arguments in clear, concise and coherent
writing.  According to Bezos: "When you have to write your ideas out in
complete sentences, complete paragraphs it forces a deeper clarity."
Andy Grove considered written reports vital because “the author is
forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.”</p>
<p>As for the story-telling narrative, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/386e57b2-52a9-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec">Bezos said</a> : "We
have so many metrics . . . and the thing I have noticed is that when the
anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.
There’s something wrong with the way you’re measuring." He believes in
telling a story vividly, rather than relying on data or graphics. (Have
you read of his <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm">handstand
story</a>
in his letter to shareholder?)</p>
<p>Component #2: six page limit. Precision counts. It requires a lot of
work for the team to deeply understand their own space, gather the data,
understand the operating tenets and be able to communicate all these
clearly. The Amazon team member often rewrite the memo several times to
make the writing "interesting and easy to read" before presenting to the
senior team. </p>
<p>As for the data, the validation, the information that feeds into the
narrative that doesn't carry the structure, they go into the appendixes
for completeness and cross reference.</p>
<p>Component #3: silent reading session. This is the weirdest meeting I'd
imagine. When asked "Why don't you read the memos in advance?" Bezos
replied "Time doesn't come from nowhere.  This way you know everyone has
the time. The author gets the nice warm feeling of seeing their hard
work being read." </p>
<p>Here is a recommendation on how to structure a six-pager. FWIW, it's a
reasonable starting point that I'd try to base my 2019 annual plans on.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the past it was like this …</li>
<li>Then something happened …</li>
<li>So now we should do this …</li>
<li>So the future might be like this …</li>

        <p>Property investor believes in the average numbers and she seeks above
average opportunities. Value investor believes in 80/20 rule and she
looks for outliers.  </p>
<p>Property investor focuses on the middle part of the bell curve. Value
investor spends her time at the tail end.</p>
<p>Property investor expects a moderate return on her investment. Value
investor bets on 10x returns from her money.</p>
<p>Property investor is right most of the time. Value investor is wrong
seven or eight times out of ten.</p>
<p>Property investor looks elsewhere for references to set her price. Value
investor looks into spreadsheets for models and assumptions. </p>
<p>Property investor likes a good story. Value investor likes a good story
too, but she loves a great financial model even better.</p>
<p>Property investor's main contribution is her capital. Value investor's
contribution is her thoughts, perspectives and unique understanding of a
demographic, a market or a technology. Capital is a ticket for her to
get involved.</p>
<p>There are many more property investors than value investors.  Like many
things in life, there is no right or wrong to each approach.  But as an
early stage entreprenuer, it is critical that we develop the
intellectual muscle to quickly figure out what makes the other person
tick. </p>
