        <p>John Doerr's recent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure what
matters</a>
described a simple framework for goal setting, tracking and continuous
learning. You can watch his <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals?language=en">12 minute TED
talk</a>
for a quick overview. This post summarises the key ideas without the
examples.</p>
<h3>What is OKRs?</h3>
<p>OKRs, Short for Objectives for Key Results. It's a collaborative
goal-setting protocol for companies, teams and individuals. OKRs
are not silver bullet. They cannot substitute for sound judgement,
strong leadership, or a creative workspace culture. But if those
fundamentals are in place, OKRs can guide you to the mountaintop.</p>
<p>OKRs is a management methodology that helps to ensure that the company
focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the
organisation. </p>
<p>An OBJECTIVE is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less.
By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented,
and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed,
they're a vaccine against fuzzy thinking --- and fuzzy execution.</p>
<p>KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective.
Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, agreesive yet realistic.
Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. </p>
<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
<p>OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and coordination.
They link diverse operations, lending purpose and unity to the entire
organisation.</p>
<p>Many companies have a "rule of seven," limiting managers to a maximum of
seven direct reports. In some cases, Google has flipped the rule to a
<em>minimum</em> of seven. The higher the ratio of reports, the flatter the
org chart --- which means less top-down oversight, greater frontline
autonomy, and more fertile soil for the next break-through. OKRs help
make all of these good things possible.</p>
<p>Psychology professional Edwin Locke:  "Hard goals" drive performance
more effectively than easy goals.  "Specific hard goals" produce a
higher level of output" than vaguely worded ones.</p>
<p>A two-year Deloitte study found that no single factor has more impact
than "clearly defined goals" that are written down and shared freely ...
Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Acute focus, open sharing, exacting measurement, a license to shoot for
the moon --- these are the hallmarks of modern goal science.</p>
<h3>The Father of OKRs - Andy Grove from Intel</h3>
<p>"Expertise was very much valued (at Fairchild)," Andy explained. "That is
why people got hired. That's why people got promoted. Their
effectiveness at translating that knowledge into actual results was kind
of shrugged off." At Intel, he went on, "we tend to be exactly the
opposite. It almost doesn't matter what you know. It's what you can do
with whatever you know or can acquire and actually accomplish [that]
tends to be valued here." Hence the company's slogan: "Intel delivers."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two key phrases ... are objectives and key result. And they match
the two purposes. The objective is the direction: "We want to dominate
the mid-range microcomputer component business." That's an objective.
That's where we're going to go. Key results for this quarter: "Win ten
new designs for the 8085" is one key result. It's a milestone. The two
are not the same ..."</p>
<p>The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and
without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No?
Simple. No judgements in it.</p>
<p>Now, did we dominate the mid-range microcomputer business? That's for
us to argue in the years to come, but over the next quarter we'll know
whether we've won ten new designs or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Objective and the Key Results strike a balance of long- and
short-range planning, informed by data and encriched by regular
conversations among colleagues. </p>
<p>Andy sought to "create an envrionment that values and emphasizes output"
and to avoid what Peter Drucker termed the "activity trap": "Stressing
output is the key to increasing productivity, while looking into
increase activity can result in just the opposite."</p>
<h3>OKRs superpowers - Focus</h3>
<p>Measuring what matters begins with the question: <em>what is most
important for the next three (or six, or twelve) months?</em> Successful
organisations focus on the handful of initiatives that can make a real
difference, deferring less urgent ones. Their leaders commit to those
choices in word and deed. By standing firmly behind a few top-line
OKRs, they give their teams a compass and a baseline for assessment.</p>
<p>Wrong decisions can be corrected once results begin to roll in.
Nondecisions --- or hastily abandoned ones --- teach us nothing. <em>What
are our main priorities for the coming period? Where should people
concentrate their efforts?</em> An effective goal-setting system starts with
disciplined thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and
energy to choose what counts.</p>
<p>While paring back a list of goals is invariably a challege, it is well
worth the effort. As any seasoned leader will tell you, no one
individual --- or company --- can "do it all." With a select set of
OKRs, we can highlight a few things --- the vital things --- that must
get done, as planned and on time.</p>
<p>Leaders must get across the <em>why</em> as well as the <em>what</em>. Their people
need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for
meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission. And the
process can't stop with unveiling top-line OKRs at a quarterly all-hands
meeting. "When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear
it."</p>
<p>To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative deliverables, one
solution is to pair key results --- to measure "both effect and
counter-effect". From Andy Grove:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The paired counterparts should stress the quality of the work. Thus,
in accounts payable, the number of vouchers processed should be
paired with the number of errors found either by auditing or by our
suppliers. For another example, the number of square feet cleaned by a
custodial group should be paired with a ... rating of the quality of
work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>OKRs superpowers - Alignment</h3>
<p>If you tell everybody to go to the center of Europe, and
some start marching off to France, and some to Germany, and some to
Italy, that's no good. Not if you want them all going to Switzerland. If
the vectors point in different directions, they add up to zero. But if
you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you maximise the
result.</p>
<p>Research shows that public goals are more likely to be attained than
goals held in private. Simply flipping the switch to "open" lifts
achievement across the board. In a recent survey of one thousand working
U.S adults, 92 percent said they'd be more motivated to reach their
goals if colleagues could see their progress.</p>
<p>In an OKR system, the most junior staff can look at everyone's goals, on
up to the CEO. Critiques and corrections are out in public view.
Contributors have carte blanche to weight in, even on flaws in the
goal-settings process itself. Meritocracy flourishes in sunlight.</p>
<p>Once top-line objectives are set, the real work begins. As they shift
from planning to execution, managers and contributors alike tie their
day-to-day activities to the organisation's vision. The term for this
linkage is alignment. According to Harvard Busienss Review, companies
with highly aligned employees are more than twice as likely to be top
performers.</p>
<p>To avoid compulsive, soul-killing overalignment, healthy organisations
encourage some goals to emerge from the bottom up. Salespeople
understand shifting customer demands before management does; financial
analysts are the earliest to know when the fundamentals of a business
change.</p>
<p>Micromanagement is mismanagement. A healthy OKR environment strikes a
balance between alignment and autonomy, common purpose and creative
latitude. </p>
<p>An optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some
of their own objectives and most or all of their key results. People are
led to stretch above and beyond, to set more ambitious targets and
achieve more of those they set. When our <em>how</em> is defined by others, the
goal won't engage us to the same degree. By loosening the reins and
backing people to find <em>their</em> right answers, we help everybody win.</p>
<p>As business becomes more intricate and initiatives more complex,
interdependent divisions need a tool to help them reach the finish line
together. A transparent OKR system promotes this sort of freewheeling
collaboration once people across the whole organisation can see what's
going on.</p>
<h3>OKRs superpowers - Track for accountability</h3>
<p>One underrated virtue of OKRs is that they can be tracked --- and then
revised or adapted as circumstances dictate. OKRs are living, breathing
organisms. Their life cycle unfolds in three phases.</p>
<p>The setup phase gives OKRs a home, where they are connected on a daily basis
with people. Without frequent status updates, goals slide into
irrelevance; the gap between plan and reality widens by the day.
Contributors are most engaged when they can actually see how their work
contributes to the company's success. </p>
<p>The midlife tracking phase tracks and shows how everyone is progressing.
Research suggests that making measured headway can be more incentivising
than public recognition, monetary inducements, or even achieving the
goal itself. Regular check-ins --- preferaby weekly --- are essential to
prevent slippage. As Peter Drucker observed, "Without an action plan,
the executive becomes a prinsoner of events. And without check-ins to
reexamine the plan as events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing
which events really matter and which are only noise."</p>
<p>The wrap-up phase consist of three parts: objective scoring, subjective
self-assessment, and reflection. </p>
<p>The simplest, cleanest way to score an objective is by averaging the
percentage completion rates of its associated key results. </p>
<ul>
<li>0.7 to 1.0 = green. (We delivered.)</li>
<li>0.4 to 0.6 = yellow. (We made progress, but fell short of completion.)</li>
<li>0.0 to 0.3 = red. (We failed to make real progress.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In evaluating the performance, objective data is enhanced by the goal
setter's thoughtful, subjective judgement. Say the team's objective is
to recruit new customers, and your individual key result is fifty phone
calls. You wind up calling thirty-five prospects, for a raw goal score
of 70 percent. Did you succeed or fail? By itself, the data doesn't
afford us much insight. But if a dozen of your calls lasted several
hours apiece and resulted in eight new customers, you might give youself
a perfect 1.0. Conersely: If you procrastinated, rushed through all
fifty calls, and signed only one new customer, you might assess your
performance at 0.25 --- because you could have pushed harder. (And on
reflection: Should the key result have prioritised new customers, rather
than calls?) In the end, the numbers are probably less important than
contextual feedback and a broader discussion within the team.</p>
<p>Reflection is the intentional attempts to synthesise, abstract and
articulate the key lessons taught by experience. Asks the questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what contributed to my
  success?</li>
<li>If not, what obstacles did I encounter?</li>
<li>If I were to rewrite a goal achived in full, what would I change?</li>
<li>What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next cycle's
  OKRs?</li>
<li>What did I learn that I didn't foresee at the beginning of the quarter? How will
I apply this lesson in the future?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The first estimate, from Adrian Zenz, a social scientist at the
European School of Culture &amp; Theology, is based on an accounting of
the detention camp populations totalling some 892,000 individuals in
68 Xinjiang counties as of the Spring of 2018. </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>The second estimate comes from the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit
Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD). Between mid-2017 and mid-2018,
CHRD interviewed eight ethnic Uighurs located in eight different
villages in southern Xinjiang. Each person gave their own estimate of
the number of people detained in their village, which CHRD used to
surmise a detention rate for each village. These village detention
rates ranged from 8 to 20 percent, averaging out to 12.8 percent
across all eight villages. Just as Zenz did, CHRD “conservatively”
rounded down to reach a 10 percent estimated detention rate.</p>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3292226">When State-Building Hinders Growth: The Legacy of China's Confucian
Bureaucracy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do countries with a long history of state-building fare better in the
long run? Recent work has shown that earlier state-building may lead
to higher levels of present-day growth. By contrast, I use a natural
experiment to show that the regions of China with over a thousand
years of sustained exposure to state-building are significantly poorer
today. The mechanism of persistence, I argue, was the introduction of
a civil service exam based on knowledge of Confucian classics, which
strengthened the social prestige of the civil service and weakened the
prestige of commerce. A thousand years later, the regions of China
where the Confucian bureaucracy was first introduced have a more
educated population and more Confucian temples, but lower levels of
wealth. The paper contributes to an important debate on the Great
Divergence, highlighting how political institutions interact with
culture to cause long-run patterns of growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a neat article with some interesting data points. I love to
believe in the conclusion but I think the author has the cause and
effect sequence wrong. </p>
<p>I think the poorer parts of China tend to be flatter, share common
langauge, thus easier to rule through a central state. But because of
their location, they are too far away from the coast to benefit from
international trades. The wealthier parts tend to have poor
transportation system, more cut-off from the central state and, without
a better choice, had to rely more on trade, thus enjoying the fruits
from doing so.</p>

        <p>I finally found time to sit down and watch Ray Dalio's famous 30 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0">How The
Economic Machine Works</a>
video. It's totally different from the classic Econ 101 but it feels more
practical and seems to explain the world economy better and in a simpler
way. </p>
<p>Things I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit/debt boosts growth first and depress it later. Credit
  encourages spending which boosts economy; however the need to pay back
  the debts reduced spending which depresses the economy. </li>
<li>Higher interest rate lowers the assets present value. Given the same
  future cash flow projection, higher interests rate means higher
  discounts, which means lower present value.</li>
<li>Stock market goes down when economy and profit growth is strong. This
  is counter-intuitive but it's part of the natural cycle.</li>
<li>Short-term cycle is 7-10 years and long-term cycle takes about 70-100
  years.</li>
<li>Productivity matters in the long run. Credit matters in the short run.</li>
<li>When the economy becomes deflationary because of the contraction from
  debt payment, printing money converts credits to money. So printing
  money is inflationary. It works because as long inflation is higher
  than deflation, the debt burden is taken care of. The key is to
  balance the inflation and deflation.</li>
<li>The term "Lost decade" comes because of a long term readjustment takes
  10 years for the market to go back to where it was. Even when the
  deleveraging is handled perfectly, it will still take 3 years for
  going down and another 7 to go back to where it was. </li>
<li>Three advices: don’t let debt increase faster than income, otherwise
  the debt will crush you; don’t let income rises faster than
  productivity growth, otherwise you will become less competitive;
  always improve the productivity because it is what matters in the long
  run.</li>

        <abbr class="published" title="2019-01-07T22:56:00+13:00">

        <p>Many of my friends were shocked when they heard that our <a href="https://happymoose.nz/">photo printing
business</a> made everything in New Zealand instead
of China. People couldn't believe that, with all of our automation,
we can provide the same service in New Zealand 25% cheaper than getting
them done in Shanghai --- this doesn't even include the international
shipping cost yet. </p>
<p>The common belief is that outsourcing is an inevitable trend. Small
countries like New Zealand can't do anything about it, except
just following along and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>I disagree. I have the evidence to believe that there are certain types
of businesses that'd be better off manufacturing in New Zealand, to stay
close to their market.</p>
<p>Bloomberg recently published a long opinion piece on this topic called
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-19/clothing-manufacturing-may-be-moving-back-to-west-from-asia">Your Clothes Could Be Made in the USA
Again</a>.
The article has done an excellent job describing the key factors that
are causing apparel production jobs to move back to local markets or
neighbouring countries (Like Mexico for the US). </p>
<p>Here are the four key reasons for brands to make the move. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stress their heritage and increase control over supply chains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burberry and other British fashion labels have moved some of their
production as “Made in England” became attractive to luxury buyers
after an import boom in the 1990s and early 2000s. Hugo Bosss, the
German fashion label, has started selling a “Made in Germany”
collection, produced completely (except for some fabrics) in
Metzingen, the company’s corporate seat.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed beats marginal cost advantage and basic compliance is upgraded to an integrated sustainability strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Failure to respond to demand for an item consumers have seen on
Instagram may mean huge volumes of unsold clothing. Unable to tell
consumers what they should wear, producers must treat short lead times
as the No. 1 priority.  Fast fashion is giving way to ultra-fast
fashion, as practiced by online retailers such as Boohoo, Asos and
Lesara. This doesn’t work well with shipping from Asia: Delivery to
big Western markets takes about 30 days by sea.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shortened lead time increases gross profit margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as lead times gain importance, shortening them compensates for
some of the labor cost disadvantage by increasing the share of clothes
sold at the full price. Raising it by 6.1 percent for a garment that
takes 60 minutes to produce would justify the transfer of production
from China to the U.S., McKinsey calculated.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation and robotics drive down production cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automation can drive down the cost in Western countries. Now, sewing a
pair of jeans takes an average of 19 minutes, more than half of the
total production time. McKinsey and RWTH Aachen figure robotics can
cut that time by 40 percent to 90 percent. At another important step,
distressing the jeans, technology exists to cut the time necessary
from about 20 minutes to 90 seconds: Levi’s does it with lasers. </p>

fireball</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple today announced that it expects to generate revenues of about
$1.4 billion to $1.45 billion in the June quarter, down from previous
guidance of about $1.6 billion. The lower-than-expected revenues are
primarily due to soft demand in the consumer and creative markets
such as advertising and publishing. Geographically, revenue shortfall
is expected to be offset significantly by higher-than-expected gross
margins primarily due to lower costs of some components. Accordingly,
the Company has revised its earnings guidance from $.08 to $.10 per
diluted share, compared to previous guidance of $.11 or slightly
higher.</p>
<p>"Like others in our industry, we are experiencing a slowdown in sales
this quarter. As a result, we're going to miss our revenue
projections by around 10%, resulting in slightly lower profits," said
Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "We've got some amazing new products in
development, so we're excited about the year ahead. As one of the few
companies currently making a profit in the PC business, we remain
very optimistic about Apple's prospects for long-term growth".</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is John Gruber's commentary on the writing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the tight construction of that message from Apple in 2002.
First paragraph: put out the numbers. Second paragraph: it’s an
industry-wide problem, but Apple has “amazing new products” coming.
And then the kicker, the dagger: “As one of the few companies
currently making a profit in the PC business…”.</p>
<p>We’ve got some short term bad news but don’t worry, we have this.”
And… out. Short and sweet. Rip off the bad news Band-Aid, express
quiet confidence that Apple is in great shape, and that’s it. Message
over.</p>

   how to get. At scale.</a> </li>
<li>Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term
   people.</li>
<li>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.
   Most people haven't figured this out yet.</li>
<li>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth,
   relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</li>
<li>Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above

<li>Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are

<li>Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be
    unstoppable.</li>
<li>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and
    <a href="/hello-2019.html">leverage</a></li>
<li>Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If
    society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.</li>
<li>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and
    passion rather than whatever is hot right now.</li>
<li>Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look
    like work to others.</li>
<li>When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not
    schools.</li>
<li>Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot
    be outsourced or automated.</li>
<li>Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.

<li>The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands:

<li>"Give me a leverl long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move
    the earth." - Archimedes.</li>
<li>Fortune require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital,
    people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and
    media).</li>
<li>Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge,
    with accountability, and show resulting good judgement.</li>
<li>Labour means people working for you. It's the oldest and most
    fought-over form of leverage. Labour leverage will impress your
    parents, but don't waste your life chasing it.</li>
<li>Capital and labour are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing
    capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to
    lead, but someone has to follow you.</li>
<li>Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage
    behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works
    for you while you sleep.</li>
<li>An army of robots is freely available --- it's just packed in data
    centres for heat and space efficiency. Use it.</li>
<li>If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and
    podcasts. </li>
<li>Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.</li>
<li>Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning
    foundational skills.</li>
<li>There is no skill called "business". Avoid business magazines and
    business classes.</li>
<li>Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics,
    mathematics, and computers.</li>
<li>Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
    (AD: what the hell does this mean? Spend less time socialising and
    more time reading? Just do it mentality?)</li>
<li>You should be too busy to "do coffee", while still keeping an
    uncluttered calendar. </li>
<li>Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a
    problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If

<li>There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else

        <abbr class="published" title="2019-01-04T14:22:00+13:00">
          Published: Fri 04 January 2019
        </abbr>
        <p>This full thread is from
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/stevesi/status/1081174886901473280">@stevesi</a>. 
Steven Sinofsky is one of the best strategic thinkers and this thread
talks about the topics I blogged <a href="/platform-wins-by-turning-everyone-into-commodity-sellers.html">yesterday</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the typical way for a luxury brand to broaden its appearl. </li>
<li>How does a platform make money?</li>
<li>How does players on a platform make their money? </li>
<li>How has Apple avoided been bogged down by the partners?</li>
</ol>
<p>(I'm re-typing everything again so I get to appreciate his points
better.  Steven, or twitter, owns his tweets. Not me. )</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple has long known it is missing the boat on providing low priced
   phones --- strategic mistake to cede "low end" to Android. Or raised
   prices too much/soon. Then it must be an easy answer to just lower
   prices or make low priced phones. Ack! Harder than it looks.</li>
<li>Pricing is much more sophisticated than this. Pricing not only says
   who can afford your product but also establishes a brand, determines
   channel &amp; more.  Many say Apple is a luxury brand; certainly they
   focused on that.</li>
<li>PC v Mac really showed the weakness in appealing to luxury brand in a
   volume driven market. High prices were the undoing of the Mac  from
   the very early days. 
   Going back to 1990, height of Apple, PCs sold at 10X the Mac run
   rate. But Macs had much higher margins per device.</li>
<li>While available software was a big part of that 10X, reality was that
   a Mac computer also cost substantially more than a PC, and depending
   on configuration was often 2X the price.
   Everyone knew. Apple/Jobs refused to license Mac System enabling
   cheaper Macs (one approach).</li>
<li>PC strategy was low everyday prices for PCs. BUT there was a catch or
   three --- really important to think about relative to iPhones
   pricing.
   PCs were made up of hardware, OS, chips. To have low prices Intel and
   Microsoft benefited from an ecosystem that "raced to the bottom".</li>
<li>Intel and Microsoft held on to most of the profits in selling PCs
   (and MS w/Office). The retailers and PC makers had very slim (to
   zero) margins for two decades. Often PC hardware seemed like a
   suckers bet.</li>
<li>The first key to having low priced offerings is that you have to have
   a set of partners who are willing to compete on thin margins in order
   to bring the product to market. 
   Very tough for one player to be the high margin and low margin
   players. Race yourself to the bottom?</li>
<li>The second key thing PCs benefitted from was a channel that allowed
   distribution by price maintaining price walls - business PCs could be
   expensive/sold direct (ThinkPad); consumer PCs sold as a bundles with
   high margin components useless as business PCs. (Dell's Inspiron and
   Optiplex etc.)</li>
<li>Buying a PC was a complex navigation through model line selected by
   segment (Big Business direct, SMB, individual, Education,
   Government). Then each form factor was "good, better, best".
   Byzantine. That's how you offer low prices and avoid everyone paying
   and have some margin.</li>
<li>Plus that is where crapware comes from --- those partners need some
    way to make margin. Adding software, selling screen real-estate, and
    so on are the only tools remain that allow for partners to make
    something when hardware and OS are fixed. </li>
<li>This is how business always does premium+low priced offers, eg
    clothing where brands stand for luxury but aspire to mass market.
    Brands like Calvin Klein, Ralph Laruen, Armani w/ topi tier labels
    (like Purple) at select channels or direct. BUT also have mass
    market/discount.</li>
<li>Each of those distribution points is a different label, different
    quality, and so on. No retailer that carries Purple will carry Sport
    or RL. They might want to but they won't be allowed to ---
    distribution constraint that is carefully managed.</li>
<li>So when people say Apple needs a cheaper phone there are many
    questions to answer beyond the "get over yourself" luxury brand
    issue.
    What is distribution constraint? What partner absorbs some cost to
    leave margin? What is the branding? </li>
<li>Easy question --- would a cheap phone be sold and supported in Apple
    stores side by side? How would the rest of the customers feel about
    more crowds and tougher appointments competing with people who paid
    half as much? Sell one phone against another --- how? </li>
<li>This doesn't even have to be a product question which most people
    jump to --- sure remove fancy camera, memory, storage,e tc.
    But these are all hardware items that competitive products will
    simply add and market against --- "buy our android phone with
    portrait mode".</li>
<li>Apple is constrained by software because apps need to work on all
    devices --- something that Apple has stretched further than Windows
    ever did (watch to phone to tablet, and soon Mac). ISVs/devs will
    never embrae API differences at different price points. </li>
<li>Consumers bemoan Windows 10 Home, Pro, Enterprise. Insane energy
    goes into trying to have features that don't fragment developers and
    OEMs (drivers, etc) and can be deployed efficiently while alos
    maintaining price differentiation. That's literally the entire
    Windows business. </li>
<li>The levers available to do cheaper products are not all available to
    Apple. Those that simply say they have a pricing problem need to
    solve for the product, the distribution, the branding, and more.</li>
<li>Big companies become <em>enormously</em> consternated over brand value
    props, channel conflicts, and so on. Where Apple avoided all of
    these was owning them all. The downside of owning them all is this
    limits responding to the challenges.</li>
<li>At Microsoft we always reminded ourselves that you don't sell 300M
    of something at one every day low price. Most all energy was to
    maintain price floor. 
    <em>AMAZINGLY</em> Apple managed to sell over 200M of something per year at
    pretty much one every day high price, then increased price.</li>
<li>Anyone that thinks Apple is unaware of the challenge and has not
    sketched out ideas, tested them, and thought about them immensely is
    crazy. Literally this consumes a company or at least has been the
    past year. </li>
<li>Example --- I can't count how many times Windows/Office toyed with
    "lite" versions. Fewer features cost less. DUH! Imaging such product
    and <em>everyone</em> wants it. How do you market it? What brand is it? How
    much revenue do you forgo? Is it freemium? trialware? annoying?</li>
<li>Literally the constant drumbeat from the press, partners, channel
    was that PCs were too expensive, Windows or Office too expensive. No
    matter what the price was. Also Intel hearing the same. Magic for
    Intel/MS was getting others to cave --- who caves for Apple?</li>
<li>I once  ran the numbers on selling just one SKU of Office rather
    than the seemingly infinite number. It was literally billions of
    dollars of lost revenue immediately and more over time --- leaving
    revenue on table PLUS alienating customers at both high end and low
    end. </li>
<li>What does all these mean? Apple may or may not have a "pricing" or
    "price point" or "structural"/secular challenge. For sure just
    releasing a cheap phone doesn't make all better. 
    All takes place in context of lots of cheap/bad competitive phones. 
    Lots to consider.</li>

        <abbr class="published" title="2019-01-03T15:22:00+13:00">
          Published: Thu 03 January 2019
        </abbr>
        <p>The Verge recently ran a featured story on the risks of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">operating in
Amazon's
Marketplace</a>. </p>
<p>Amazon's Marketplace is an e-commerce platform where 6 million sellers
compete against each other to fulfil your orders. Near two third of the
items sold on Amazon are sold by these third-party sellers. </p>
<p>It turns out that some sellers use Amazon's own rules against each
other, devising intricate schemes to get their rivals suspended.  Once
suspended from the platform, sellers find themselves in a bewildering
appeals system. </p>
<p>To quote the story: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have manipulated product reviews on our site,” an email from
Amazon read. “This is against our policies. As a result, you may no
longer sell on Amazon.com, and your listings have been removed from
our site.”</p>
<p>A rival had framed Plansky for buying five-star reviews, a high crime
in the world of Amazon. The funds in his account were immediately
frozen, and his listings were shut down. Getting his store back would
take him on a surreal weeks-long journey through Amazon’s bureaucracy,
one that began with the click of a button at the bottom of his
suspension message that read “appeal decision.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sad situation to find yourself in as a small business
owner. Plansky certainly had my sympathy. But sadly this is to be expected.</p>
<p>I understand that selling through other people's platform saves tons of
money from marketing, giving a young business a headstart at the
beginning. But building one's entire distribution channel on top of
Amazon is willfully ignoring the basic rule at play here.</p>
<p><strong>The platform wins by making everyone else a replaceable commodity.</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two kinds of businesses: value creation
and arbitrage. </p>
<p>Value creation sets out to make a difference, and the primary
way to win is to create something new that people didn't know they want
it. </p>
<p>Arbitrage is to focus on the things people know they want and identify
the suboptimal market opportunities and buy-low-sell-high. </p>
<p>Value creation makes something new and demands a premium. It wins
through exclusivity. Arbitrage removes any inefficiency in the market
and drives the cost down and makes the products available to a broader
audience.</p>
<p>The platforms win by making all sellers play the arbitrage game. It's a
volume based market. It's a race to the bottom" game. Not a value
creation one. As a business owner, it's our responsibility to know which
game we are playing and deal with our hands well.</p>

<p><a href="https://continuations.com/post/181045939520/uncertainty-wednesday-leadership-under">What's the difference between second guessing and
re-evaluating?</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former is questioning a decision without material new information.
The latter is revisiting a decision after material new information has
been obtained. It is second guessing which is destructive for morale,
because it calls into question not just the decision but also undermines
the legitimacy of the decision making process itself.</p>
<p>Re-evaluating on the other hand is healthy but requires a good decision
making process. In particular, there has to be a relatively clear way of
assessing whether something is in fact material new information.</p>

<p>Guesstimate is a tool for performing estimates using monte carlo

of providing ranges and distributions as values instead of individual

cells/metrics. After each new input is added or changed, a set of 5000
samples is randomly generated from each input and goes through the
specified operations to produce confidence intervals in the output.</p>

Eroded trust in institutions and technology, dicey US, messy Brexit and
sluggish China predicates a difficult macro business and political
environment. Technology, riding the transition wave from industry age to
information age, will continue to grow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2018, we saw social media usage in the US flatten out and possibly
even start to decline a bit.And the usage of screen time management
apps, like Screentime on iOS, is surging. We know we are addicted to
tech, we don’t want to be, and we are working on getting sober.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>All of this lost trust is challenging for big tech, and the tech sector
in general, but is also a huge opportunity for new companies and new
technologies that can offer different products and business models that
we can trust more, or don’t need to trust.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This loss of trust in 2018 was not limited to the tech sector. In the
US, and also in many places around the world, we are losing trust in our
institutions and our elected officials.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I expect the combination of higher rates, uncertainty in Washington, and storm clouds globally (which we will get to soon) will cause business leaders in the US to become more cautious on hiring and investment. Consumers will make essentially the same calculations. And that will lead to a weaker economy in the US in 2019.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The startup/tech economy is somewhat immune to macro trends. Many startups and big tech companies were able to grow and expand their businesses during the last financial downturn in 2008 and 2009. Some very important tech companies were even started in those years.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The tech/startup economy is driven first and foremost by technical and creative (ie business model) innovation. And that is not impacted by the macro environment.</p>
<p>So I expect that we will continue to see big tech invest and grow their
businesses and do well in 2019.</p>
<p>However, I do think a difficult macro business and political environment in the US will lead investors to take a more cautious stance in 2019.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But all of that is going to happen at the margin. I expect 2019 to be another solid year for the tech/startup sector as we are in a possibly century-long conversion from an industrial economy to an information economy and the tailwinds for tech/startup vs the rest of the economy remain in place and strong.

Design</a>:
I've never been a big fan of Material design from Google or the Metro
style from Microsoft. Apparently it takes <strong>twice</strong> amount of cognitive
load for people to use these flat design interfaces! Twice!  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past few years flat user interface design has become the
predominating visual style of operating systems, websites and mobile
apps. Although flat design has been widely criticized by HCI and
usability experts, empirical research on flat design is still scarce.
We present the results of an experimental comparative study of visual
search effectiveness on traditional and flat designs. The following
types of visual search tasks were examined: (1) search for a target
word in text; (2) search for a target icon in a matrix of icons; (3)
search for clickable objects on webpages. Time and accuracy parameters
of the visual search, as well as oculomotor activity, were measured.
The results show that a search in flat text mode (compared with the
traditional mode) is associated with higher cognitive load. A search
for flat icons takes twice as long as for realistic icons and is also
characterized by higher cognitive load. Identifying clickable objects
on flat web pages requires more time and is characterised by a
significantly greater number of errors. Our results suggest replacing
the flat style user interfaces with interfaces based on the design
principles developed over decades of research and practice of HCI and
usability engineering. </p>
