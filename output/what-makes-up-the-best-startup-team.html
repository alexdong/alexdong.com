<p>We all know that building a startup team is hard yet crucial.  But given so many other factors that are involved in this brutal survival game, there hasn't been much research done on answering the question: <strong>what makes up the best team?</strong> Shall we pick a group of really talented people and put them together and wait it to settle down by itself? Or maybe find a team that has done works together since they know each other much better so communication cost and team coherency is better? If the reality is somewhere between these two extreme sides, where is the balance point?</p>
<p>Finally I ran into one <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all">great and long article</a> on this topic.  The article itself has many parts to it and it's not as smooth as it could be. But there are so many nuggets it it that I strongly recommend you reading it from cover to cover.</p>
<p>Here is the answer for those impatient ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uzzi found that the people who worked on Broadway were part of a social network with lots of interconnections: it didn’t take many links to get from the librettist of “Guys and Dolls” to the choreographer of “Cats.” Uzzi devised a way to quantify the density of these connections,<strong> a figure he called Q. If musicals were being developed by teams of artists that had worked together several times before</strong>—a common practice, because Broadway producers see “incumbent teams” as less risky—<strong>those musicals would have an extremely high Q</strong>. A musical created by a team of strangers would have a low Q.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uzzi then tallied his Q readings with information about how successful the productions had been. “Frankly, I was surprised by how big the effect was,” Uzzi told me. “I expected Q to matter, but I had no idea it would matter this much.” According to the data, the <strong>relationships among collaborators emerged as a reliable predictor of Broadway success.</strong> When the Q was low—less than 1.7 on Uzzi’s five-point scale—the musicals were likely to fail. Because the artists didn’t know one another, they struggled to work together and exchange ideas. “This wasn’t so surprising,” Uzzi says. “It takes time to develop a successful collaboration.” <strong>But, when the Q was too high (above 3.2), the work also suffered.</strong> The artists all thought in similar ways, which crushed innovation. According to Uzzi, this is what happened on Broadway during the nineteen-twenties, which he made the focus of a separate study. The decade is remembered for its glittering array of talent—Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II, and so on—but Uzzi’s data reveals that ninety per cent of musicals produced during the decade were flops, far above the historical norm. “Broadway had some of the biggest names ever,” Uzzi explains. “But the shows were too full of repeat relationships, and that stifled creativity.”</p>
<p><strong>The best Broadway shows were produced by networks with an intermediate level of social intimacy.</strong> The ideal level of Q—which Uzzi and his colleague Jarrett Spiro called the <strong>“bliss point”—emerged as being between 2.4 and 2.6.</strong> A show produced by a team whose Q was within this range was three times more likely to be a commercial success than a musical produced by a team with a score below 1.4 or above 3.2. It was also three times more likely to be lauded by the critics. “The best Broadway teams, by far, were those with a mix of relationships,” Uzzi says. “These teams had some old friends, but they also had newbies. This mixture meant that the artists could interact efficiently—they had a familiar structure to fall back on—but they also managed to incorporate some new ideas. They were comfortable with each other, but they weren’t too comfortable.”</p>
<p>Uzzi’s favorite example of “intermediate Q” is “West Side Story,” one of the most successful Broadway musicals ever. In 1957, the play was seen as a radical departure from Broadway conventions, both for its focus on social problems and for its extended dance scenes. The concept was dreamed up by Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, and Arthur Laurents. They were all Broadway legends, which might make “West Side Story” look like a show with high Q. But the project also benefitted from a crucial injection of unknown talent, as the established artists realized that they needed a fresh lyrical voice. After an extensive search, they chose a twenty-five-year-old lyricist who had never worked on a Broadway musical before. His name was Stephen Sondheim.</p>
