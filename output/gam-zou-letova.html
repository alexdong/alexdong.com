<p>The more I learn about Israel and its culture, the more I like it.</p>
<p>One concrete example is this kind of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ilan-abehassera">optimism</a> after a total unfair treatment from a company whose motto is "Don't be Evil".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the interesting part. On my last day at Zlio, I had a long discussion with Jeremie, and despite the bad times, Jeremie was still very optimistic and even relieved I would say. Why? He told me his life’s theory, and it’s based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</a> principle that I’ve been following ever since, and that has changed my life (yes really).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In hebrew we say “<a href="http://www.neveh.org/price/price2.html">Gam Zou Letova</a>”, that could be translated by : “Everything that happens in your life is for your own good”, or, “Every challenge makes you stronger”. You get the idea.</p>
<p>When Jeremie explained it to me, I had a hard time understanding this optimistic principle in such hard times in his professional life. All he said was, don’t worry, good things will happen after this tough experience.</p>
<p>This is the story about the screw-over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the little story, Zlio, became blacklisted/sandboxed by Google 6 months after…. It killed the company…</p>
