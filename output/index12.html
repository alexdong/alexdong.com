<p>It took him a few years to get going on that, but once he started, there was no turning back.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are a little crazy. That’s a good thing. Some of us can’t do anything else, and can’t take a normal job- and <strong>if we did try to take one, no matter how good of a situation it is, we’d blow it up</strong>. I think having an experience like the one that Noah had at Facebook teaches a lot of different things- not just who we are, but also who we’re not. It’s lucky, in my opinion, that he had such a pivotal experience so early in his career. It means that he’s free, for the rest of his life, to pursue who he really wants to be. Everyone should share that kind of experience</p>

<p>It's not often for me to become interested in technology itself these days. But the discussion between git pull and git rebase has interested me a lot.  Not for its own technology details but more as a tool to either loose or strengthen an engineering culture.</p>
<p>git pull encourages a rather loose, relax and, in the long run, ad-hoc manner of team work.  This suits startup cultures quite well.   It's fast to learn and easy for people who migrate from older version controls like subversions to learn.  Engineers works on his own little branch. He has no reason to integrate with other people's code until the very end of one's little project is finished.  The commit history ends up having messages that describes more about the code and less about the reason and thinking behind this list of patches.  For example, if you happen to follow the resque project, you'll realize that <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque/commit/832fb9d696c4367ae17d99aaa2ef6b43268605c5">a commit message like this</a> is not really that helpful. 7 lines of changes.  One line comment without explaining why the 'destroy' is delayed.</p>
<p>git rebase encourages comparatively stricter engineering culture. One has to pay attention to not only his code, but also the commit histories.  Projects like linux kernel uses it to enforce a culture of <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html"> keep clean history</a>. Linus even wrote up what a good commit would look like <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface/blob/master/README#L161">here. </a>  I can see how this could be very helpful in a project where the code needs to be maintained 15 years later by totally different set of people.  A clean history, instead of a loose list of incremental functional changes, will provide more context in the long run.  As a sample,<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766"> check out this patch</a> by Linus for a firmware related patch. <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blobdiff;f=drivers/base/firmware_class.c;h=81541452887bd3ce5d868909e3fb753fb3d6b124;hp=e85763de928f096e46cbfd74abb69c064e5c2101;hb=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766;hpb=e1cc485262846dcad931bf85ee655cbbb815bfe6">4 lines</a> of changes, 8 lines of comments on the commit.</p>

<p>Think it's hard to keep a balanced life? Check this one out. The ex NASA Space Shuttle Flight Director wrote how he looked back on 2002 when he <a href="http://waynehale.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/ten-years-after-columbia-balancing-work-and-life/">seems to live a balanced life but end up costing people's life</a>. Certainly not directly but ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it; the job and all my extracurricular activities, it’s a wonder I had time to sleep.  I guarantee I wasn’t bored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this walk down memory lane is not about trying to impress you; no doubt you have had similarly active times in your own life.  The point is that we started to miss critical safety issues in 2001 and 2002.  In early 2003 we paid the price for that inattention.</p>
<p>So I ask you; in a high reliability organization, one which is engaged in risky, highly complex activities with cutting edge technology; how much time does any individual need to devote to making the activity successful and safe?</p>
<p>Nothing on my list of activities was a bad thing; without a doubt I was making a difference to my family and in my community.  Some life moments are inescapable; death of a beloved family member is one of those.  No matter how far in advance you see it coming, you can never be ready for that.</p>
<p>The old saying “all work and no play makes jack a dull boy” also bears elements of truth.  Time for recreation and reflection is necessary to do ones best.</p>
<p>But in spite of all of that rationalization, a decade later, the regret over not playing a more important role, one that would have prevented the Columbia tragedy, lays like a pall over my memories of those days.</p>
<p>He grew even bitter admitting that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in a High Reliability Organization, you have to pay attention.  The more extreme the risk, the more difficult the environment, the more complex the technology, the more attention you must pay.  But life intrudes.  As the song says, there are planes to catch and bills to pay, and too there are little children to play with.  You cannot work all the time, and if the balance gets too far either way, a price will be exacted.  Once upon a time I wrote:  “pay attention, do good work, have no regrets”.  True, but far too simplistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2002 I thought we were paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I thought I was paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I was a Flight Director.  I was also a husband and a father and active in my community.  I thought I could do it all.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So work was a 60 hour a week job; it was always on my mind.  There were a thousand details to plan and decide and brief to management.  Even then I recognized that there were a million details in the shuttle business that I couldn’t participate in; there just wasn’t enough time or energy for any one person to do it all.  The folks in the shuttle program office, Ron Dittemore, Linda Ham, and the rest, they had a tough job.  Tougher than you know.  Tougher than I knew at the time.  Everybody played their part, everybody was highly motivated, everybody wanted the shuttle to succeed, and yet, within months, we were all to fail.</p>
<p>Why?  Listen and learn.  Maybe you will avoid failure.  But don’t count on it.</p>

<p>I'd say the same is true for entrepreneurs. It usually takes at least 2-3 years for a young and fresh entrepreneur to hit his own stride and know what works for him the best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In listening to both of them, I heard something that I have found to be true in my own experience. It takes time to learn how to be an early stage investor. You have to make a bunch of investments and learn from them. And you have to develop a strategy, a thesis, and your own differentiated style which people can then attach to you. In effect you have to build a brand and become known for what you do and how you do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this happens overnight. I think it took my friend about four years to hit his stride. I suspect it took the Gotham Gal about as long. Part of this is that is how long it takes to know if you've made a good investment or not. You might know in two to three years. But by four years, it is going to be pretty clear. As these outcomes start coming in, you can start to see what is working and what is not.</p>
<p>And "what is working and what is not" is not just about your investment selection. <strong>It is about the fit between you and a certain kind of entrepreneur and a certain kind of target market and a certain kind of business model. Some investors are better at investing in SAAS companies. Some are better at investing in e-commerce. Some are better at investing in mobile apps. Some investors are better at working with teams that need a lot of help. Some investors are better at working with teams that don't need any help and want you to get out of the way.</strong></p>
<p>It is important to figure out who you are and where you fit in the startup economy before you can become a good investor. But once you do that, you can "hit your stride" and start investing with conviction.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer that it is possible to build a startup community where you live.  Especially as the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">software is eating the world</a>, I see lots of opportunities when you merge local and mobile together.</p>
<p>Having said this, it won't be easy. There haven't been a clear break-out yet, although New York, Seattle, Boulder are clearly leading the game. I have been consulted on how to do that in our little town Dunedin. I've talked about local capital, proven records, good quality engineers. I have wanted to summarize it into a clearly organized todo list but luckily that has been done by a <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/">very capable VC</a>: <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/09/27/what-makes-a-successful-startup-community-is-it-possible-to-build-one-where-you-live/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BothSidesOfTheTable+%28Both+Sides+of+the+Table%29">What Makes a Successful Startup Community?

<p>Have had my own humble share of fund raising, shake the hands of investors from China, US and Australia, the following article left a deep impression on me.  For anyone who is raising capital, please keep this one in mind.   To be fair, the most successful investors start out as entrepreneurs, like Ben Horowitz, Mark Anderson. But there are also non-trivial pencentage of investors who just haven't done it before.  When they give advices, I frown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of startups, it’s convenient to read the Picasso quote as a tidy summarization of the difference between critics (VCs and the tech press) and practitioners (entrepreneurs). There is some truth to this. When entrepreneurs get together, they tend to talk about tactical details. VCs and the press talk about trends, markets, and other abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Picasso was just being modest. He thought about the meaning of his art far more deeply than his critics did. The same is true of great entrepreneurs. “Cheap turpentine” is important, but so is “Form and Structure and Meaning”. The best ideas emerge from the interplay between the two modes of thought.</p>

<p>Future usually unfolds itself bit-by-bit. And here is another crack.</p>
<p>I have long heard of the term "computational photography" where techniques like linear algebra could be used to transform one shape into another. But to see it in effect is still mind numbing. Checkout the following video where using open source software,  "people are removed from a space".  Think of surveillance devices. Think about using photo and video as evidences in court. We're truly living in an exciting time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Transient Faces</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through a process of foreground subtraction, the project removes people from a space which otherwise would be difficult to capture empty. Using either time-lapse sequences, movie scenes, or live video as the content, users are able to watch as the people begin to fade away and the background is reconstructed. The video below shows the image as it is being processed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking back to my earliest involvement with Wired magazine and then launching HotWired (amazingly, almost 20 and 18 years ago respectively), I am continually impressed with how much fun the business of media can be. Media sites make for inherently cyclical, constantly transforming businesses where <strong>you’re only as good as the last story you pushed out. The people who contribute are the ultimate product — the media are just the messages.</strong> If I’ve learned anything in my few decades of experience in media, the hard part is hitching yourself to the right star.</p>
