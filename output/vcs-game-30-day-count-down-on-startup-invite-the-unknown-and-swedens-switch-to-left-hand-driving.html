<blockquote>
<p>We recommend that entrepreneurs keep the funding amounts small in the early rounds when the valuations are lower and then scale up the amounts in the later rounds when it is a lot more clear how money can create value and when the valuations will be higher. This model has worked out pretty well. David Karp raised $600k, then $4mm, then 5mm, then $25mm, then $80mm (or something like that). And at the time of the sale to Yahoo!, he owned a very nice stake in the business even though he had raised well north of $100mm. He did that by keeping his rounds small in the early days and only scaling them when he had to and the valuations offered were much higher.</p>

You need to take care of employees, customers and yourself. It provides a clean slate for you to get started again. </p>

<p>It is a sign of great inner insecurity to be hostile to the unfamiliar.
Understanding is not a piercing of the mystery, but an acceptance of it, a living blissfully with it, in it, through and by it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H">Dagen H</a>: Dagen H(D day) was the day when traffic in Swden switched from driving on the left-hand side to the right.  The government and the public have done a thorough job that there was actually less accidents when the switch happened.  It's amazing that nowadays the governments seem to have less apetite for this kind of massive project anymore. 
Bonus: checkout the Headlamp sold in Sweden not long before Dagen H.</p>
