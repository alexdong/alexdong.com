I am still running zsh side-by-side since I've got too many customisations there but fish's work-out-of-box is so refreshing and rather enjoyable compared to maintaining one's own oh-my-zsh forks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we do hit peak smart phone penetration, how might the app store dynamics change? Itâ€™s hard to know before it happens but here are a few thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited demand for applications should increase the average cost per install. This will drive developers to pursue apps with increasing monetization to support higher costs of acquisition.</li>
<li>We will have maturity in utility categories like email clients, phone clients, web browsers; some turnover in social networks; most turnover in games. Utilities tend to be downloaded by new users and infrequently replaced. But gamers swap out the next platformer as soon as they are bored.</li>
<li>Decreasing attractiveness of the marginal smart phone user in terms of ARPUU. New smart phone users will increasingly live outside of the most developed markets.</li>
</ol>
