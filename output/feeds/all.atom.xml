&lt;p&gt;This one is a letter from Steve Jobs. It's so tightly crafted that it's almost beautiful.  (Source: &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/steve_jobs_and_apples_last_previous_earnings_warning"&gt;Daring

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple today announced that it expects to generate revenues of about
$1.4 billion to $1.45 billion in the June quarter, down from previous
guidance of about $1.6 billion. The lower-than-expected revenues are
primarily due to soft demand in the consumer and creative markets
such as advertising and publishing. Geographically, revenue shortfall
is expected to be offset significantly by higher-than-expected gross
margins primarily due to lower costs of some components. Accordingly,
the Company has revised its earnings guidance from $.08 to $.10 per
diluted share, compared to previous guidance of $.11 or slightly
higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Like others in our industry, we are experiencing a slowdown in sales
this quarter. As a result, we're going to miss our revenue
projections by around 10%, resulting in slightly lower profits," said
Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "We've got some amazing new products in
development, so we're excited about the year ahead. As one of the few
companies currently making a profit in the PC business, we remain
very optimistic about Apple's prospects for long-term growth".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is John Gruber's commentary on the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the tight construction of that message from Apple in 2002.
First paragraph: put out the numbers. Second paragraph: it’s an
industry-wide problem, but Apple has “amazing new products” coming.
And then the kicker, the dagger: “As one of the few companies
currently making a profit in the PC business…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got some short term bad news but don’t worry, we have this.”
And… out. Short and sweet. Rip off the bad news Band-Aid, express
quiet confidence that Apple is in great shape, and that’s it. Message
over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like yesterday, I'm handcopying the full thread here as a way to
appreciate and understand it better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key concepts: specific knowledge (proprietary knowledge is what I prefer
to call it), leverage, accountability, and judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn
   while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is
   your place in the social hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly
   despise wealth, it will elude you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking
   people playing wealth creation games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own
   equity --- a piece of a business --- to gain your financial freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll get rich by &lt;a href="/platform-wins-by-turning-everyone-into-commodity-sellers.html"&gt;giving society what it wants but does not yet know
   how to get. At scale.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term
   people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.
   Most people haven't figured this out yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth,
   relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above
   all, integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are
    self-fulfilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be
    unstoppable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and
    &lt;a href="/hello-2019.html"&gt;leverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If
    society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and
    passion rather than whatever is hot right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look
    like work to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not
    schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot
    be outsourced or automated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.
    Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands:
    Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. (AD: Trump? Really?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Give me a leverl long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move
    the earth." - Archimedes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortune require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital,
    people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and
    media).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge,
    with accountability, and show resulting good judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labour means people working for you. It's the oldest and most
    fought-over form of leverage. Labour leverage will impress your
    parents, but don't waste your life chasing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital and labour are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing
    capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to
    lead, but someone has to follow you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage
    behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works
    for you while you sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An army of robots is freely available --- it's just packed in data
    centres for heat and space efficiency. Use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and
    podcasts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning
    foundational skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no skill called "business". Avoid business magazines and
    business classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics,
    mathematics, and computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
    (AD: what the hell does this mean? Spend less time socialising and
    more time reading? Just do it mentality?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should be too busy to "do coffee", while still keeping an
    uncluttered calendar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a
    problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If
    outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource
    it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you
    work on are more important than how hard you work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep refining what you
    do until this is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else
    getting rich off you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply specific knowledge, with leverage and good judgement, and
    eventually you will get what you deserve. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you're finally wealthy, you'll realise that it wasn't what you
    were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day. (AD:
    This is pretty fruastrating way to end a thoughtful thread. )&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How has Apple avoided been bogged down by the partners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I'm re-typing everything again so I get to appreciate his points
better.  Steven, or twitter, owns his tweets. Not me. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple has long known it is missing the boat on providing low priced
   phones --- strategic mistake to cede "low end" to Android. Or raised
   prices too much/soon. Then it must be an easy answer to just lower
   prices or make low priced phones. Ack! Harder than it looks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing is much more sophisticated than this. Pricing not only says
   who can afford your product but also establishes a brand, determines
   channel &amp;amp; more.  Many say Apple is a luxury brand; certainly they
   focused on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PC v Mac really showed the weakness in appealing to luxury brand in a
   volume driven market. High prices were the undoing of the Mac  from
   the very early days. 
   Going back to 1990, height of Apple, PCs sold at 10X the Mac run
   rate. But Macs had much higher margins per device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While available software was a big part of that 10X, reality was that
   a Mac computer also cost substantially more than a PC, and depending
   on configuration was often 2X the price.
   Everyone knew. Apple/Jobs refused to license Mac System enabling
   cheaper Macs (one approach).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PC strategy was low everyday prices for PCs. BUT there was a catch or
   three --- really important to think about relative to iPhones
   pricing.
   PCs were made up of hardware, OS, chips. To have low prices Intel and
   Microsoft benefited from an ecosystem that "raced to the bottom".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel and Microsoft held on to most of the profits in selling PCs
   (and MS w/Office). The retailers and PC makers had very slim (to
   zero) margins for two decades. Often PC hardware seemed like a
   suckers bet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first key to having low priced offerings is that you have to have
   a set of partners who are willing to compete on thin margins in order
   to bring the product to market. 
   Very tough for one player to be the high margin and low margin
   players. Race yourself to the bottom?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second key thing PCs benefitted from was a channel that allowed
   distribution by price maintaining price walls - business PCs could be
   expensive/sold direct (ThinkPad); consumer PCs sold as a bundles with
   high margin components useless as business PCs. (Dell's Inspiron and
   Optiplex etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying a PC was a complex navigation through model line selected by
   segment (Big Business direct, SMB, individual, Education,
   Government). Then each form factor was "good, better, best".
   Byzantine. That's how you offer low prices and avoid everyone paying
   and have some margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plus that is where crapware comes from --- those partners need some
    way to make margin. Adding software, selling screen real-estate, and
    so on are the only tools remain that allow for partners to make
    something when hardware and OS are fixed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how business always does premium+low priced offers, eg
    clothing where brands stand for luxury but aspire to mass market.
    Brands like Calvin Klein, Ralph Laruen, Armani w/ topi tier labels
    (like Purple) at select channels or direct. BUT also have mass
    market/discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each of those distribution points is a different label, different
    quality, and so on. No retailer that carries Purple will carry Sport
    or RL. They might want to but they won't be allowed to ---
    distribution constraint that is carefully managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So when people say Apple needs a cheaper phone there are many
    questions to answer beyond the "get over yourself" luxury brand
    issue.
    What is distribution constraint? What partner absorbs some cost to
    leave margin? What is the branding? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy question --- would a cheap phone be sold and supported in Apple
    stores side by side? How would the rest of the customers feel about
    more crowds and tougher appointments competing with people who paid
    half as much? Sell one phone against another --- how? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This doesn't even have to be a product question which most people
    jump to --- sure remove fancy camera, memory, storage,e tc.
    But these are all hardware items that competitive products will
    simply add and market against --- "buy our android phone with
    portrait mode".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple is constrained by software because apps need to work on all
    devices --- something that Apple has stretched further than Windows
    ever did (watch to phone to tablet, and soon Mac). ISVs/devs will
    never embrae API differences at different price points. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers bemoan Windows 10 Home, Pro, Enterprise. Insane energy
    goes into trying to have features that don't fragment developers and
    OEMs (drivers, etc) and can be deployed efficiently while alos
    maintaining price differentiation. That's literally the entire
    Windows business. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The levers available to do cheaper products are not all available to
    Apple. Those that simply say they have a pricing problem need to
    solve for the product, the distribution, the branding, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big companies become &lt;em&gt;enormously&lt;/em&gt; consternated over brand value
    props, channel conflicts, and so on. Where Apple avoided all of
    these was owning them all. The downside of owning them all is this
    limits responding to the challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Microsoft we always reminded ourselves that you don't sell 300M
    of something at one every day low price. Most all energy was to
    maintain price floor. 
    &lt;em&gt;AMAZINGLY&lt;/em&gt; Apple managed to sell over 200M of something per year at
    pretty much one every day high price, then increased price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone that thinks Apple is unaware of the challenge and has not
    sketched out ideas, tested them, and thought about them immensely is
    crazy. Literally this consumes a company or at least has been the
    past year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example --- I can't count how many times Windows/Office toyed with
    "lite" versions. Fewer features cost less. DUH! Imaging such product
    and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants it. How do you market it? What brand is it? How
    much revenue do you forgo? Is it freemium? trialware? annoying?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literally the constant drumbeat from the press, partners, channel
    was that PCs were too expensive, Windows or Office too expensive. No
    matter what the price was. Also Intel hearing the same. Magic for
    Intel/MS was getting others to cave --- who caves for Apple?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I once  ran the numbers on selling just one SKU of Office rather
    than the seemingly infinite number. It was literally billions of
    dollars of lost revenue immediately and more over time --- leaving
    revenue on table PLUS alienating customers at both high end and low
    end. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does all these mean? Apple may or may not have a "pricing" or
    "price point" or "structural"/secular challenge. For sure just
    releasing a cheap phone doesn't make all better. 
    All takes place in context of lots of cheap/bad competitive phones. 
    Lots to consider.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon's Marketplace is an e-commerce platform where 6 million sellers
compete against each other to fulfil your orders. Near two third of the
items sold on Amazon are sold by these third-party sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that some sellers use Amazon's own rules against each
other, devising intricate schemes to get their rivals suspended.  Once
suspended from the platform, sellers find themselves in a bewildering
appeals system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote the story: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have manipulated product reviews on our site,” an email from
Amazon read. “This is against our policies. As a result, you may no
longer sell on Amazon.com, and your listings have been removed from
our site.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rival had framed Plansky for buying five-star reviews, a high crime
in the world of Amazon. The funds in his account were immediately
frozen, and his listings were shut down. Getting his store back would
take him on a surreal weeks-long journey through Amazon’s bureaucracy,
one that began with the click of a button at the bottom of his
suspension message that read “appeal decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sad situation to find yourself in as a small business
owner. Plansky certainly had my sympathy. But sadly this is to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that selling through other people's platform saves tons of
money from marketing, giving a young business a headstart at the
beginning. But building one's entire distribution channel on top of
Amazon is willfully ignoring the basic rule at play here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The platform wins by making everyone else a replaceable commodity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, there are two kinds of businesses: value creation
and arbitrage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value creation sets out to make a difference, and the primary
way to win is to create something new that people didn't know they want
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitrage is to focus on the things people know they want and identify
the suboptimal market opportunities and buy-low-sell-high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value creation makes something new and demands a premium. It wins
through exclusivity. Arbitrage removes any inefficiency in the market
and drives the cost down and makes the products available to a broader
audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platforms win by making all sellers play the arbitrage game. It's a
volume based market. It's a race to the bottom" game. Not a value
creation one. As a business owner, it's our responsibility to know which
game we are playing and deal with our hands well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Two kinds of doubt, guesstimate, prediction, Fira and flat design is bad</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/two-kinds-of-doubt-guesstimate-prediction-fira-and-flat-design-is-bad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-02T15:22:00+13:00</published><updated>2019-01-02T15:22:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2019-01-02:/two-kinds-of-doubt-guesstimate-prediction-fira-and-flat-design-is-bad.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few great links/tools I found in the last a few days. &lt;/p&gt;

because it calls into question not just the decision but also undermines
the legitimacy of the decision making process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-evaluating on the other hand is healthy but requires a good decision
making process. In particular, there has to be a relatively clear way of
assessing whether something is in fact material new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getguesstimate/guesstimate-app"&gt;Guesstimate&lt;/a&gt;:
Exceptionally designed and fresh tool for making estimations. If nothing
else, do check out the screencast on the web page. It's mind blowing
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guesstimate is a tool for performing estimates using monte carlo
experiments. It can be used similarly to excel, but provides the option
of providing ranges and distributions as values instead of individual
points. Other metrics can do mathematical operations on these
cells/metrics. After each new input is added or changed, a set of 5000
samples is randomly generated from each input and goes through the
specified operations to produce confidence intervals in the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eroded trust in institutions and technology, dicey US, messy Brexit and
sluggish China predicates a difficult macro business and political
environment. Technology, riding the transition wave from industry age to
information age, will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, we saw social media usage in the US flatten out and possibly
even start to decline a bit.And the usage of screen time management
apps, like Screentime on iOS, is surging. We know we are addicted to
tech, we don’t want to be, and we are working on getting sober.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this lost trust is challenging for big tech, and the tech sector
in general, but is also a huge opportunity for new companies and new
technologies that can offer different products and business models that
we can trust more, or don’t need to trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loss of trust in 2018 was not limited to the tech sector. In the
US, and also in many places around the world, we are losing trust in our
institutions and our elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect the combination of higher rates, uncertainty in Washington, and storm clouds globally (which we will get to soon) will cause business leaders in the US to become more cautious on hiring and investment. Consumers will make essentially the same calculations. And that will lead to a weaker economy in the US in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startup/tech economy is somewhat immune to macro trends. Many startups and big tech companies were able to grow and expand their businesses during the last financial downturn in 2008 and 2009. Some very important tech companies were even started in those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech/startup economy is driven first and foremost by technical and creative (ie business model) innovation. And that is not impacted by the macro environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I expect that we will continue to see big tech invest and grow their
businesses and do well in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do think a difficult macro business and political environment in the US will lead investors to take a more cautious stance in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that is going to happen at the margin. I expect 2019 to be another solid year for the tech/startup sector as we are in a possibly century-long conversion from an industrial economy to an information economy and the tailwinds for tech/startup vs the rest of the economy remain in place and strong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode"&gt;FiraCode&lt;/a&gt;: Fonts designed by
programmers for programmers. I have just switched all my dev environment
to this new font. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several
characters. For the human brain, sequences like -&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;= or := are
single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on
the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse
and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all
programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode
symbols for operators, but that’s not the case yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281628009_Flat_Design_vs_Traditional_Design_Comparative_Experimental_Study"&gt;Flat Design vs. Traditional
Design&lt;/a&gt;:
I've never been a big fan of Material design from Google or the Metro
style from Microsoft. Apparently it takes &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt; amount of cognitive
load for people to use these flat design interfaces! Twice!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years flat user interface design has become the
predominating visual style of operating systems, websites and mobile
apps. Although flat design has been widely criticized by HCI and
usability experts, empirical research on flat design is still scarce.
We present the results of an experimental comparative study of visual
search effectiveness on traditional and flat designs. The following
types of visual search tasks were examined: (1) search for a target
word in text; (2) search for a target icon in a matrix of icons; (3)
search for clickable objects on webpages. Time and accuracy parameters
of the visual search, as well as oculomotor activity, were measured.
The results show that a search in flat text mode (compared with the
traditional mode) is associated with higher cognitive load. A search
for flat icons takes twice as long as for realistic icons and is also
characterized by higher cognitive load. Identifying clickable objects
on flat web pages requires more time and is characterised by a
significantly greater number of errors. Our results suggest replacing
the flat style user interfaces with interfaces based on the design
principles developed over decades of research and practice of HCI and
usability engineering. &lt;/p&gt;

a new and unknown journey. It was the same excitement when I boarded a
two-day train ride to go to a university that's 2000km away. Or when
Zephyr and I decided to leave China and spend a year travelling when I
turned 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm energised by the new leverages I have. In 2019, I will have a team
and a modest amount of capital I get to use.  I finally have the
resources to execute the plans.  It'll be so much fun to work closely
with a team again, especially when their experiences and career paths are
so diverse.  The last two years has been a slow burn.  I could see that
I had hit a plateau. I was running at full throttle, but life 
stayed in the same place. The more the business grew,
the more tasks I needed to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, the less concentration time I have, the
less I learned and the less productive I became. It was a
draining experience that I'm glad it's over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm energised by the product I will work on. I have been in and out the
personal photo space for 12 years now. I feel I have learned a
tremendous amount, not only on the technology side of what's possible
but also a deeper understanding of the human emotional needs photo print
products fulfil. With the rest of the business in capable hands, I will
finally have the space to explore the problem domain again and give it
my best shot. To build something I'd be proud of&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also energised by the opportunities for personal growth. I used to
spend most of my time playing with different technologies and
under-developed my social and interpersonal skills. So in 2019, I'm
looking forward to learning from the amazing people I work with.  Of
their expertise. And how they communicate. I can't wait to read a long
list of books that'll certainly broaden my horizon. And lastly, I am
looking forward to the daily meditation and blog post exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 2019, here we come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there was also a drop of pressure to perform, a pinch of
anxity and a small touch of fear of failure. But the excitement
surprised me as it was so vivid and so young.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should develop the muscle to appreciate both. After all, we are born
with a left brain for logic and a right brain for intuition.
Why should we only use one?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief that numbers are cold and cruel. I think
numbers give us a sense of agency. Instead of feeling powerless and at
the mercy of a giant random number generator in the sky, a good model
with a few numbers will help us see the world clearer.  As an
individual, we'll know what to do with our energy and our limited life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of cool examples. Each takes a thorny question with
substantial social and moral implications and comes up with an experiment to
put a definite number on them. I find the designs fascinating and the
numbers revealing some fascinating aspects of the human psyche. I hope you
enjoy them too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First. How much is Facebook worth to a user? Answer: $1000 per year.
Quoting from the &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global
users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are
hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three
non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to
deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the
populations sampled and the auction design differ across the
experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would
require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While
the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on
the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these
services provide for their users are large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second. Whose life worth more? An infant or a pregnant woman? A dog or a
a criminal?  Tough questions, huh?  Well, there is an
answer to that. Infant. And dog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting is that this is also a global preference, which
means that it's the same across 233 countries and cultures. (Here
is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6/figures/2"&gt;a direct
link&lt;/a&gt; to
the graph. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting from the
&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on Nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns
about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of
quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that
should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed
the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore
the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered
40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233
countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this
experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we
document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents’
demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and
uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these
differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits.
We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global,
socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this
article are publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

well-off way and the real way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootstrap way starts by giving each player $50. All the money needed
for the game mainly comes from the $200 salaries players draw after each
round. The game progresses slowly. Quite often, The players might see a
golden opportunity but don't have the capital to pursue.  Luck played a
significant role but everyone is more or less the same.  Stakes are low
so mistakes aren't lethal.  This is a game of perseverence, best played
with a strong sense of humor when bad luck strikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-off way begins with a grand total of $2000 or even $5000
&lt;em&gt;inherited&lt;/em&gt; for each player. When capital isn't the constraint. The game
moves ahead incredibly fast.  Houses and hotels come up like mushrooms.
Hundreds, if not thousands, dollar changing hands each night in the
hotels. Since the land disappears within the first a few rounds, the
game quickly turns into a strategic play. Negotiation and probability
thinking play far more significant role. The game feels more intense
with lots of social actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real way is the least fun. Every one gets a different amount based
on a lottery. The initial luck determines how much money each player
starts with. If you are lucky, you get $5000; if you are the least
fortunate, you get $50. The bigger the differences are, the less fun the
game is. In fact, the game sucks for everyone. Poor and rich. A bonus
point is that you can design the initial allocation based on a country's
real wealth distribution. For example, play the "New Zealand in 1978"
will give you a totally different feeling compared to "China in 2018". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootstrap way is best suited to play with friends on a snow day with
the beef stew in the slow cooker. The well-off way is more fun and
exciting to play with high IQ PE and investment bankers. The real way? I
never managed to see any group finish it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Amazon's six-pager</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/amazons-six-pager.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-28T07:22:00+13:00</published><updated>2018-12-28T07:22:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2018-12-28:/amazons-six-pager.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Within Amazon, powerpoint presentations are never used in meetings.

Instead, employees are required to write six-page narratives laying out
their points in prose and "staff meetings at Amazon begin with 30
minutes of silent reading". This is so strange that I decided to find
out more about it, with the end goal of seeing whether we should apply
this practice in our business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefit #1: Provide more context. The story-telling narrative helps to
tie all the numbers and analysis into a coherent story, providing an
opportunity to review the core data going into a decision and share the
process that leads to the final decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefit #2: Accelerate knowledge sharing. A collection of these
well-written documents enable everyone in the company to internalise a
whole new space within 30 minutes of reading. Greatly optimising how
quickly and how many different initiatives the team can work on in
parallel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefit #3: Encourage learning. The writings established the records for
future clinical examination and instituionalised proprietary learning.
When the final result is out, it'd be much easier to review and
hopefully learn from it by comparing the written records to what
actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok now the key pieces ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Component #1: writing in narrative. Writing is more honest. It's harder
to hide half-thought-out arguments in clear, concise and coherent
writing.  According to Bezos: "When you have to write your ideas out in
complete sentences, complete paragraphs it forces a deeper clarity."
Andy Grove considered written reports vital because “the author is
forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the story-telling narrative, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/386e57b2-52a9-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec"&gt;Bezos said&lt;/a&gt; : "We
have so many metrics . . . and the thing I have noticed is that when the
anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.
There’s something wrong with the way you’re measuring." He believes in
telling a story vividly, rather than relying on data or graphics. (Have
you read of his &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm"&gt;handstand
story&lt;/a&gt;
in his letter to shareholder?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Component #2: six page limit. Precision counts. It requires a lot of
work for the team to deeply understand their own space, gather the data,
understand the operating tenets and be able to communicate all these
clearly. The Amazon team member often rewrite the memo several times to
make the writing "interesting and easy to read" before presenting to the
senior team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the data, the validation, the information that feeds into the
narrative that doesn't carry the structure, they go into the appendixes
for completeness and cross reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Component #3: silent reading session. This is the weirdest meeting I'd
imagine. When asked "Why don't you read the memos in advance?" Bezos
replied "Time doesn't come from nowhere.  This way you know everyone has
the time. The author gets the nice warm feeling of seeing their hard
work being read." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a recommendation on how to structure a six-pager. FWIW, it's a
reasonable starting point that I'd try to base my 2019 annual plans on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the past it was like this …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then something happened …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So now we should do this …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the future might be like this …&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property investor expects a moderate return on her investment. Value
investor bets on 10x returns from her money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property investor is right most of the time. Value investor is wrong
seven or eight times out of ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property investor looks elsewhere for references to set her price. Value
investor looks into spreadsheets for models and assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property investor likes a good story. Value investor likes a good story
too, but she loves a great financial model even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property investor's main contribution is her capital. Value investor's
contribution is her thoughts, perspectives and unique understanding of a
demographic, a market or a technology. Capital is a ticket for her to
get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more property investors than value investors.  Like many
things in life, there is no right or wrong to each approach.  But as an
early stage entreprenuer, it is critical that we develop the
intellectual muscle to quickly figure out what makes the other person
tick. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>B2B CEOs vs. B2C CEOs</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/b2b-ceos-vs-b2c-ceos.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-26T10:12:00+13:00</published><updated>2018-12-26T10:12:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2018-12-26:/b2b-ceos-vs-b2c-ceos.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;B2C and B2B are two different kinds of businesses and they call for very

&lt;p&gt;But there is something fundamentally different here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B2B CEOs sell. Many of them went up the ladder through the sales
track. They are great salespeople and quite often they can be quite
effective task managers that &lt;em&gt;drives&lt;/em&gt; the sales pipelines.  Think
Salesforce. Or Linkedin. Both produced awful software products but no
one can argue against their market share or valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B2C CEOs, however, are product designers by heart. They are very
&lt;em&gt;sensitive&lt;/em&gt; to the product and they are obsessed with getting the user
experiences right.  Quite often they have a background in engineering. 
Having worked with a couple over the years, I can testify that they are
every bit awkward and introvert just like a typical engineer. Want some
examples? Ev Williams (Twitter), Steve Chen (my boss, YouTube and

&lt;p&gt;Why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to use writing to improve learning. Running a business means that
I always have something that's more "urgent" or "important". Learning
has been pushed down the list under the "nice but can wait till later"
category. I want to do better in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to improve my communication skill. I've been mostly working
solo in the last three years. Now that I've built a team around myself,
communication becomes more important than getting things done by myself.
I'm hoping to use writing to solidify my thinking as well as documenting
the stories while they are still fresh and raw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I feel I do have something to share with the world. My story is
hardly unique, but I hope that someone somewhere will find these posts
helpful, encouraging, or even inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. On the tactical side, I just replaced the old Jekyll site with this
Pelican installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll seems to be going strong with GitHub's support. I just couldn't
make it work again. I was on Ruby 1.9 and now the latest is 2.5.
Packages become obsolete. &lt;code&gt;gem update&lt;/code&gt; broke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I know Python better, it makes sense for me to migrate to a python
based site generator and hopefully maintaining the site will be better
in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also stripped the website to its bare bone. It's just a bunch of
markdown files with a minimum css. Creating a new post is as simple as 
creating a new &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file and publishing it is &lt;code&gt;make rsync_upload&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"But there is no baby in there."</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/but-there-is-no-baby-in-there.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-13T14:32:00+12:00</published><updated>2016-08-13T14:32:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2016-08-13:/but-there-is-no-baby-in-there.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The moment the ultrasound image showed up on the screen, both of us knew something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went into to meet our second baby for the first time but instead we saw a uterus full of grape-shaped, watery tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, the pregnancy has gone wrong from the very beginning. Key DNA pieces were missing in the fertilised egg, which triggered a disease called molar pregnancy that grows fast. So quick that it’s considered a “pre-cancer condition” that needs to be taken care of immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank the great public health system in New Zealand. Within 36 hours, the whole uterus was evacuated clean, and life went back to “normal” again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s normal regarding the day-to-day operation. The outside. Deep inside, the long wait only just started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In front of us, the best case scenario is that the hCG level keeps on dropping at a nice steady rate until it gets to a single digit, right from the peak value of 114,000, then we’ll wait another 6-12 months before we can try to have a baby again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst case scenario is that there are 15-20% chance that Zephyr will need further chemotherapy and 2% chance for this disease to become a full-on Choriocarcinoma. Even here, we are still pretty luck because this type of cancer responds very well to chemotherapy. What it does mean though is the likelihood of having another baby will be low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, things have been pretty shitty for our little family in the last a few weeks. Whenever I found myself in this situation, I will try to see what life is trying to teach me. And here are three things I’ve found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I feel incredibly lucky and profoundly grateful towards this country and the doctors, surgeons, nurses and midwives who have helped us. It took less than 48 hours from receiving the diagnosis result to a successful operation, and Zephyr discharged from the hospital. The whole process was swift, professional and even the brutal reality was delivered in the kindest way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I’ve never felt so connected with the people and the community around us. That big slab of ice in my heart was slowly melted away by the warm supports we received from our friends and the people around us. Everyone, we shared the news with would give us a big hug and told us their experiences. One of the ladies had eight miscarriages before she finally had two beautiful babies. The other had a baby that was almost full-term before the little heart stopped beating. These sad stories put our experience into perspective and pulled me out of those dark, sad and lonely places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, the very possibility of having Mia as our only child helped to bring much-needed clarity to day-to-day activities. For example, we just had a few pretty decent falls of snow, and my usual intuition had been “meh, we’ll have another one soon so let me just focus on this feature now”. This time around, I didn’t even think about work before I spent most of Monday with Zephyr and Mia so we could have all the pristine snow to ourselves. I knew very well that there would never be another 2-year-old Mia happily playing snow with daddy. Next year, she will be 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish off here is a short quote from that captures what I wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p _="%" endblockquote&gt;{% blockquote Joybell.C https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4114218 %}
"Pain is a pesky part of being human, I've learned it feels like a stab wound to the heart, something I wish we could all do without, in our lives here. Pain is a sudden hurt that can't be escaped. But then I have also learned that because of pain, I can feel the beauty, tenderness, and freedom of healing. Pain feels like a fast stab wound to the heart. But then healing feels like the wind against your face when you are spreading your wings and flying through the air! We may not have wings growing out of our backs, but healing is the closest thing that will give us that wind against our faces."&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"My anti-dillusion framework"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/my-anti-dillusion-framework.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-16T23:08:00+13:00</published><updated>2015-01-16T23:08:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2015-01-16:/my-anti-dillusion-framework.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe.”
- Voltaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple framework that I use to make sure I am not fooling myself. When I need to make a major decision, I ask myself three questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is my gut feeling? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's build a model. What are the choices? What are the evaluation criteria? I'd make a spreadsheet of these and assigned a value from 1-10 to each cell, which will give me a score for each choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does people I trust say? I will go to someone that I trust, someone will tell me his or her opinion without feeling uncomfortable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, in the process of working through the above questions, the scores will gradually converge and the answer becomes clear. Like I said, this is pretty simple technique but it has served me well. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Back for the long haul"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/back-for-the-long-haul.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-14T23:38:00+13:00</published><updated>2015-01-14T23:38:00+13:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2015-01-14:/back-for-the-long-haul.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot have happened between my last post in Apr, 2014 and now.

Bootstraping a new baby and a company at the same time haven't been too cruisy. (Although honestly I've taken a easier job because Zephyr has done a lot to shield me from the waking up three times during the night business. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am back at blogging again. The main driver is that I realised quite often I failed to provide a succinct and quick answer to many questions. I almost always have too many things I want to say and didn't know where to start. I'm hoping that writing will give me more chances to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that since Mia was born, time starts to get blurred into a continuous stream of work, cooking, baby and slep. (not always in that nice sequential order though). I lost track of interesting or important things in life. I'd like to use writing as a way to help myself to savor what has happened on that date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to write one post every day and I'll keep it raw and unpolished. The world won't grind to a halt if I make a mistake in grammar or spelling. If what I write interests you, great. If not, no drama because this time, I write for myself. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Alan Kay's reading list, List vs Grid, Window into our health and Experience the data"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/alan-kays-reading-list-list-vs-grid-window-into-our-health-and-experience-the-data.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-15T21:16:00+12:00</published><updated>2014-04-15T21:16:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2014-04-15:/alan-kays-reading-list-list-vs-grid-window-into-our-health-and-experience-the-data.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List view is better for phones and smaller tablets because good type design
implies a single column to achieve adequate font size and line length.
Designing a magazine or card based grid for larger tablets or desktop is a
lot of extra work for platforms that are not as rapidly growing in market
share. We wondered if these grid layouts yield enough marginal performance
gain on larger screens to offset the cost of building and maintaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list layout for all screen sizes is beneficial for us due to the dramatic
simplification of design and engineering problems associated with our layout
engine and the tangential benefits extending from this simplification. A list
view is easier to make responsive on all screen sizes and provides a coherent
experience across web and native apps on all devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fair elections, a nation's voting pattern tends to feature one cluster, showing a general trend of voter turnout and vote for the victorious party (though some nations' regional voter preferences can distort it). Rigged ones show a cluster, but with a smear of votes toward the upper right for incremental fraud. Extreme fraud has a second, smaller, completely separate cluster at the top right corner, signifying up to 100 percent turnout and votes for the winner.

1) create 2000+ layouts in a decision tree structure
2) select layout and apply content: It uses Branch and bound to shrink the candidate set, then it uses a dozen of heuristic like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise"&gt;Perlin noise&lt;/a&gt; to maintain an organic feel between pages.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwai_Point"&gt;Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter&lt;/a&gt; is one of the 
largest industrial facilities in New Zealand.
Between 2008 and 2013, aluminium prices fell by more than 30 percent. The owner, Rio Tinto, has 
threatened to close the Tiwai Point smelter if it can't get a cheaper deal for electricity 
from retailer Meridian, or the Government fails to give it a substantial subsidy. 
The Smelter consumes about 15% of all electricities NZ generates. So there have been lots of 
discussions of what NZ should do if Rio Tinto does shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a crazy idea. How about build a large a Bitcoin mining farm to use the electricity?&lt;br&gt;
This started as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/farmgeek/status/406637109521305601"&gt;joke&lt;/a&gt; on 
Twitter but after thinking about it for a while, it actually makes good sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the technical side of the bitcoin mining business first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of the Bitcoin system as a global ledger and each transaciton 
as a switch from asset to liability in this ledger.  The Bitcoin miners play the roles of 
the central banks except that there are &lt;a href="http://millybitcoin.com/how-many-people-are-bitcoin-mining/"&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; 
of these "central banks" out there competing to perform the "clearing house" 
function for every transaction that happens in the Bitcoin universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task of these clearing houses is very simple: they group a set of transactions together into a block,&lt;br&gt;
perform some checks and then put a stamp on it. The key step here is to "perform some check". 
This involves guessing a random number in, say, a trillion possibilities. There is no smart here. 
It's only about how fast you can brutal-force through all the possibilities and 
how cheap you can do this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all those thousands participants, only the fastest one 
will win the transaction. All the rest, despite the fact that they might be half
way through, will simply throw away the existing work and start again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the speed is determined by two factors: pure luck and the speed of the guess. 
The luck is mathmatically gauranteed to be equal, or, more accurately, random. 
Even with the fastest computer, you might still lose to a tiny computer in one's garage.
You might think that this is a terribly competitive game to get yourself into. 
But it is a fierce competition only in the sense that it's a game of lottery
where only thousand of people buys and there are hundreds of chances to win
everyday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the real factor you can control is how fast you can guess. 
Once you've invested in the hardware, the main running cost is
the electricity bill, which Tiwai Point seems to have plenty of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a common mistake to think that as we getting closer to the hard limit of 
&lt;a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/161/how-many-bitcoins-will-there-eventually-be"&gt;21-million Bitcoins&lt;/a&gt;, 
there will be no money left to be made for the miners.  Since a Bitcoin transaction won't 
succeed until it's processed by a miner. People who want 
a faster transaction, instead of waiting 7 hours, will usually offer a transaction fee.
According to the &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees"&gt;Bitcoin website&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is envisioned that over time the cumulative effect of collecting transaction fees 
will allow somebody creating new blocks to "earn" more bitcoins than will be mined 
from new bitcoins created by the new block itself. This is also an incentive to keep 
trying to create new blocks even if the value of the newly created block from 
the mining activity is zero in the far future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the new 64-bit CPU and the &lt;a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html"&gt;Object-C runtime changes&lt;/a&gt;. This is the real …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a lot of articles written about the new iPhone 5 so here I will skip all the fluffy stuff and focus on four technical changes that have caught my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the new 64-bit CPU and the &lt;a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html"&gt;Object-C runtime changes&lt;/a&gt;. This is the real deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective-C objects are contiguous chunks of memory. The first pointer-sized piece of that memory is the isa. Traditionally, the isa is a pointer to the object`s class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM64 running iOS currently uses only 33 bits of a pointer, leaving 31 bits for other purposes. Class pointers are also aligned, meaning that a class pointer is guaranteed to be divisible by 8, which frees up another three bits, leaving 34 bits of the isa available for other uses. Apple's ARM64 runtime takes advantage of this for some great performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the important performance improvement is an inline reference count. On ARM64, 19 bits of the isa field go to holding the object's reference count inline. That means that the procedure for retaining an object simplifies to only one instruction instead of five. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My casual benchmarking indicates that basic object creation and destruction takes about 380ns on a 5S running in 32-bit mode, while it's only about 200ns when running in 64-bit mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have the new &lt;a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/24/inside-apples-a7-chip-m7-motion-coprocessor-and-more-from-the-iphone-5s/"&gt;M7 chip&lt;/a&gt;. This new chip makes it possible to use a few sensors without waking up the whole "computer". But if you look inside the chip, you'll see that it's only a consolidation rather than a revolutionary step as some media painted. It still doesn't include the "active display" or "touchless control" features that the &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7235/moto-x-review/4"&gt;Moto X&lt;/a&gt; has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M7, which is actually an ARM Cortex-M3 part from NXP running at 180 MHz. The chip allows for low-power collection of motion data drawn from a Bosch Sensortec accelerometer, an STMicroelectronics gyroscope, and an AKM magnetometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After collecting information from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, the M7 performs some matrix math processing magic to produce an absolute orientation of the phone relative to the world. This data is then passed to the A7 in a neat package, probably in the form of three headings (roll, pitch, and yaw). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the A7 to monitor this sort of data would be mega-overkill, so the M7 was introduced to maintain a constant, low-power watch over these sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is the &lt;a href="http://www.multipath-tcp.org"&gt;Multi-Path TCP&lt;/a&gt; support for Siri. (See the &lt;a href="http://qz.com/126642/apples-ios7-includes-a-surprise-a-ticket-to-the-next-generation-of-the-internet/"&gt;qz coverage&lt;/a&gt; for less-technical discussions. ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother reaction to failures.
The multipath-tcp website also has a nice video demo of the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a little demo of MultiPath TCP used over Ethernet/WiFi/3G on our Linux Kernel implementation. We start an ssh-session with X-redirection and launch xscreensaver demo on the distant MPTCP-capable server. We then turn off Ethernet and WiFi and thanks to MultiPath TCP the ssh-session is able to handover the traffic to 3G without interrupting the user-experience. Without our MPTCP Linux Kernel the session would simply stop working and the user would need to restart the ssh-session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is the two new background execution modes for apps. According to the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS7.html"&gt;developer doc&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps that regularly update their content by contacting a server can register with the system and &lt;strong&gt;be launched periodically to retrieve that content in the background&lt;/strong&gt;. To register, include the UIBackgroundModes key with the fetch value in your app’s Info.plist file. Then, when your app is launched, call the setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval: method to determine how often it receives update messages. Finally, you must also implement the application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler: method in your app delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps that use &lt;strong&gt;push notifications to notify the user that new content is available can fetch the content in the background&lt;/strong&gt;. To support this mode, include the UIBackgroundModes key with the remote-notification value in your app’s Info.plist file. You must also implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method in your app delegate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSA employees participted throughout, and occupied leadership roles in the committee and among the editors of the documents
Every once in a while, someone not an NSA employee, but who had longstanding ties to NSA, would make a suggestion that reduced privacy or security, but which seemed to make sense when viewed by people who didn't know much about crypto. 
The resulting standard was incredibly complicated -- so complex that every real cryptographer who tried to analyze it threw up their hands and said, "We can't even begin to evaluate its security unless you simplify it radically". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/5/4696618/google-chrome-apps-chrome-os-windows-os-x-blink"&gt;Chrome's trojan horse strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome Apps amount to a Trojan horse for Google. By way of the Chrome browser, the company is essentially putting its own app ecosystem right on top of Windows and OS X. It’s a play that’s been months in the making. “There are still reasons why a developer would build a native app over a Chrome App today, but we’re working to tackle each one,” Rakowski says. Google began promoting a handful of Chrome Apps (then called Packaged Apps) in May. In July, its Chrome notification center was pushed out to Windows and Chrome OS users, allowing for alerts and pop-ups outside the browser window. And for months, Chrome’s developer channels have shipped with an app launcher that lives in the Windows taskbar — this launcher rolled out to the public today too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new apps look and behave much like the native apps you find on Windows and OS X. They’re built using web technologies, but also with Chrome-specific code that means they won’t be able to run on other web browsers — they’re truly Chrome apps. They can exist outside of your browser window as distinct apps, work offline, and sync across devices and operating systems. They can also access your computer’s GPU, storage, camera, ports, and Bluetooth connection. Chrome Apps are, for now, only available through Chrome on Windows or Chrome OS on a Chromebook. Mac users will have to wait another six weeks before their version of Chrome will be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html"&gt;Cannot measure productivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it". That's a cop out. Businesses manage things they can't really measure the value of all the time. How do you measure the      productivity of a company's lawyers, it's marketing department, an educational institution?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html"&gt;Cannot measure productivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it". That's a cop out. Businesses manage things they can't really measure the value of all the time. How do you measure the      productivity of a company's lawyers, it's marketing department, an educational institution?    You can't - but you still need to manage them (see Robert Austin for more).
I can see why measuring productivity is so seductive. If we could do it we could assess      software much more easily and objectively than we can now. But false measures only make things worse. This is somewhere I think we have to admit to our ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

Dave Eggers on “Selling Out”&lt;/a&gt;: A long     quote from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers"&gt;Dave Eggers&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius"&gt;A Heartbreaking Work of  Staggering Genius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing worse than this sort of activity is when people, students and teachers alike, run around college campuses calling each other racists and anti-Semites. It’s born of boredom, lassitude. Too cowardly to address problems of substance where such problems actually are, we  claw at those close to us. We point to our neighbor, in the khakis and sweater, and cry foul.  It’s ridiculous. We find enemies among our peers because we know them better, and their        proximity and familiarity means we don’t have to get off the couch to dismantle them.
Did I wonder if people would think we were selling out, that we were not fulfilling the      mission they had assumed we had committed ourselves to?
No. I did not. Nor will I ever. We just don’t care. We care about doing what we want to do   creatively. We want to be interested in it. We want it to challenge us. We want it to be       difficult. We want to reinvent the stupid thing every time. Would I ever think, before I did   something, of how those with sellout monitors would respond to this or that move? I would not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;participants were asked to predict the outcomes using either audio-only recordings, videos   with audio, or videos without sound.  Astoundingly, the prediction rate for those watching     without sound was dramatically greater than those evaluating with the sound.   In fact, those  listening to the music predicted the proper outcome about one-third of the time, the same as   chance.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper introduces some good engineering practices for designing a fanout architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spark.incubator.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Spark project&lt;/a&gt;: When memory is so cheap, why don't run mapreduce in memory? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark was initially developed for two applications where placing data in memory helps: iterative algorithms, which are common in machine learning, and interactive data mining. In both cases, Spark can run up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce. However, you can use Spark for general data processing too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1988 to 2003, solving the same model using linear programming sees an improvement by a factor of roughly 43 million.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of this, a factor of roughly 1,000 was due to increased processor speed, whereas a factor of roughly 43,000 was due to improvements in algorithms! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opens up the possibility of uninterrupted server upgrade by gradually replacing old processes with new ones.  This used to be a big selling point for erlang, but now languages like Ruby, Python or node.js would be able to do it too. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"A problem statement for the web, bootstrap's way of thinking, a password manager follows unix philosophy and rules on writing c/c++ shared libraries"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/a-problem-statement-for-the-web-bootstraps-way-of-thinking-a-password-manager-follows-unix-philosophy-and-rules-on-writing-cc-shared-libraries.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-26T09:44:00+12:00</published><updated>2013-08-26T09:44:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-08-26:/a-problem-statement-for-the-web-bootstraps-way-of-thinking-a-password-manager-follows-unix-philosophy-and-rules-on-writing-cc-shared-libraries.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People ask me "why do you build &lt;a href="http://choir.io"&gt;choir.io&lt;/a&gt;". Yes,
the &lt;a href="http://choir.io/player/f9c750f2bedb0c0f"&gt;Github Realtime Activity&lt;/a&gt; 
demo is cool, but are you really going to bet your next startup on this?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer is yes and this post explains why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years from now, most of us will handle
casual computing tasks with wearable computers.  We don't know what 
the devices might look like but it's almost certain that we will be 
communicating with them using voice commands.  Google Moto X's 
&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522054/moto-x-always-listening-voice-commands-new-notifications"&gt;"always listening"&lt;/a&gt;
feature enables us to talk to the phone without having to launch an 
app. Google's voice search is finally fast enough to keep up with 
my natural speaking speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the options for computers to communicate back to us 
are still very limited. Your email client might play a ding sound
when a new email arrives. But the sound stays the same regardless of whom 
the mail is sent from and how important it is to you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ears are born multi-tasking masters. As I am
typing this, I could hear the heat pump's humming, 
the wind blowing the leaves and the light tapping of snow flakes on the 
window.  All at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also, almost effortlessly, notice changes of a sound among 
different background "noises".  Without looking out of the window, I can tell 
that the snow has just turned into a sleety rain, because the soft snow
falling sound has become much louder as the ice hitting the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound is the perfect medium for wearable computers to talk back to us. 
Sound has a dozen of properties that we can tune to convey different 
level of emotions and intrusiveness.  Different sound packs would fit 
into various contexts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Choir comes in. Choir provides a programmable
interface to translate events into a rich set of context-aware sounds.
Our users mark events with emotions and intrusivenss and we take care of the
rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Choir too early for the market? Certainly not. Choir has three 
killer applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, ambient sound monitoring. By associating user or server 
activities with different sounds, you can stay aware of the current statuses
without having to look at the graphs. If something unusual happens, you would
hear the changes almost subconsciously.  Failed login requests, rejected 
credit card transactions, 500 errors are a few good examples here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, notify without interruptions. Today your notifications are 
mostly delivered via email or chat room messages. You have to bear the cost
of context switches to checkout these messages.  Choir can provide you 
with a more fine-grained control over different type of notifications. 
For example, you might choose to play a pleasant, low-intrusive sound
when a user gives a kudos to a support ticket, but you would probably want to
select a negative and intrusive sound, maybe a sea monster roar, if a 
user just unsubscribed from your service. If you hear too many of the 
scary sea monster noises, you will know something is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, celebrate with others.  Some companies would hit a giant
gone when they close a new deal. It is a great morale booster to bring 
the whole team together and share the excitement of successes. 
Now you could configure Choir to play a cheerful sound when a new paid
user sign up for your service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested to give Choir a go, please request an invite at 
&lt;a href="http://choir.io"&gt;http://choir.io&lt;/a&gt;. You can also visit our &lt;a href="http://choir.uservoice.com"&gt;support
forum&lt;/a&gt; and tell us what you think. 
We'd love to hear from you. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Facebook's Huxley, looking inside Dropbox, short writing style guide and easy to be a jerk online"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/facebooks-huxley-looking-inside-dropbox-short-writing-style-guide-and-easy-to-be-a-jerk-online.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-15T22:25:00+12:00</published><updated>2013-08-15T22:25:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-08-15:/facebooks-huxley-looking-inside-dropbox-short-writing-style-guide-and-easy-to-be-a-jerk-online.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- links&lt;/h2&gt;

Android's notification center. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/stammy"&gt;@stammy&lt;/a&gt; summarized it up here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My love of Android lies heavily with the way Android handles notifications. These aren't your useless "read-only" iOS notifications that just launch the app. I've thought about notifications a lot while I working on the (twitter's) notifications team; how to keep the user in control and make it clear what each notification is actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it's your entire phone command center. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://designpepper.com/blog/drips/redefining-undefined"&gt;Redefining 'undefined'&lt;/a&gt;: This short post tells a fascinating story of &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; in javascript. &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is both a "global variable", which means it can be assigned to, and an immutable value where &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is the only instance of the type.&lt;br&gt;
If you are not confused enough, check out &lt;a href="http://designpepper.com/blog/drips/the-difference-between-boolean-objects-and-boolean-primitives-in-javascript"&gt;The Difference Between Boolean Objects and Boolean Primitives in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. The gist here is that if you create a &lt;code&gt;new Boolean(false)&lt;/code&gt; object and use it in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement, you'll get the result as if it is a &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The author gives 6 guesses on why this is the case. My theory is that technology evolves much faster than human beings. Once a habit is formed, it'll be there for the rest of one's life.  The widening gaps between generations in the &lt;a href="http://lancewiggs.com/2013/08/12/living-forward/"&gt;millennial test&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of how hard it is to change habits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not premeditate anything. I just winged it, and when I saw problems I triaged them. The Slashdot system was very much evolved and not designed.   One thing I learned is don’t spend your entire life playing predictive defense against attacks that will never happen. Real people are very clever. If they choose to attack you they’ll attack you in ways you can’t predict.
Most people are just purely passive consumers, and that’s okay. I think a lot of people in this space obsess too much over trying to convert passives into actives. Some people are just wired to be that kind of person. Others aren’t. That’s okay.
With more and more voices, you tend toward broader subjects. Eventually it becomes less and less interesting. But what’s interesting to [me] isn’t always the thing that’s most lucrative. I had a pretty strong belief that the population of Slashdot users was relatively fixed. That makes for a crappy business model. You want to have a million really good users and be done? How does make the chart go up and to the right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I found only the real photo captures all these characters. The participants seems to lack one of these "action, brilliant or depressed".  I happend to notice that his left eye seems to lack the paranoid and a color of brilliance. &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070916132644AAArXuY"&gt;Turned out&lt;/a&gt; "Hemingway's left eye was defective from birth ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InnoDB FTS fills a need for those people who want the features and capabilities of InnoDB but can’t modify their existing applications or who just don’t have enough FTS traffic to justify building out a Sphinx/Solr/Lucene-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone still printing photos? 
Research firm InfoTrends did a survey of Internet connected households in EU, and photo printing went up 11% in 2012 compared to 2007-2008. Similarly, U.S.-based online photo printing has become a big deal, growing by about 20% annually between 2007-2012 according to market research firm IbisWorld. Three significant reasons for this growth are: the adoption of digital cameras, ability to transport photos online, and the increase in broadband and mobile Internet connections.
48% of the online photo printing market in the U.S. being prints on paper..   11.2% canvas and frame prints; 19.7% photobooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2012/10/30/why-i-subscribe-to-the-ann-arbor-chronicle/"&gt;Why I subscribe to the Ann Arbor Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;: My ideal local newspaper in 2020 will be one run by volunteers, locals vote for issues to be covered and volunteers would write subjective report. Ann Arbor Chronicle's donation increase over the last a few years seems to confirm the possibility of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in September 2008, the Ann Arbor Chronicle is an online newspaper that focuses on civic affairs and local government coverage. Although we’d likely be classified by most folks as “new media,” in many ways we embrace an ethos that runs contrary to current trends: Longer, in-depth articles; an emphasis on factual accuracy and thoroughness, not speed; and an assumption that our readers are thoughtful, intelligent and engaged in this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/"&gt;What the Heck is Shadow DOM?&lt;/a&gt;: HTML's own way for building custom controls. The idea is there could a hidden dom structure that's normally hidden from javascript and css. The custom control author can choose to expose some of it via psuedo-selectors. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type="slider"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; are good examples. More concrete use cases can be found &lt;a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Component_Model_Use_Cases"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2013/08/01/staring-at-the-sun-dalvik-vs-spidermonkey/"&gt;Staring at the Sun: Dalvik vs. ASM.js vs. Native&lt;/a&gt;: Javascript does have the promise of a popular language. It's messy. It's ugly. It has layers and layers of patches yet everytime you feel it has hit a wall, a project like &lt;a href="http://asmjs.org"&gt;asm.js&lt;/a&gt; will come and lift it into stratosphere. 
Sometimes I do hope that WebOS would make it to the end if the &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem"&gt;webkit issues were that easy to solve&lt;/a&gt;. I sincerely wish FireFox and Mozilaa best luck in breaking up the walled gardens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asm.js is reasonably competitive with native C++ code on ARM. Even discarding the one score where asm.js did better, it executes at around 70% of the speed of native C++ code. These results suggest that apps with high performance needs can use asm.js as the target of choice for critical hot-path code, achieving near native performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asm.js competes very well on mobile performance compared to Dalvik. Even throwing out the benchmarks that are highly favourable to asm.js (binary-trees and fasta), there seems to be a consistent 10-50% speedup over comparable Dalvik code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of mass surveillance, however, the RSA key exchange is a serious liability. Your adversaries might not have your private key today, but what they can do now is record all your encrypted traffic. Eventually, they might obtain the key in one way or another (e.g., by bribing someone, obtaining a warrant, or by breaking the key after sufficient technology advances) and, at that time, they will be able to go back in time to decrypt everything.

Here are the main ideas from "art school's true exercises": &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take n pictures of a single object, making sure that no two were the same (n was generally some large number like '100' or '250') - 
   The exercise was designed to train yourself to begin to see the many ways it's possible to approach a subject...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an object and take the exact same picture of it every hour for 24 hours (generally an inanimate object... ) - 
   The goal was to see how even something that doesn't move changes quite radically depending on what is going on around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take 100 pictures of objects that have a common characteristic (they're all buildings, they're all less than 1 inch wide, 
   they're all blue, etc.) - The goal was to learn how to find interesting pictures 'hiding inside' everyday objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take 100 pictures from a perspective you wouldn't normally think to take pictures from (lying down, under water, 
   upside down, cropped to 1x6, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these four steps could be mapped to the similar process in learning and mastering the art of programming, ie 
learning your tool, understand the context, form your own opinion and open up to new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Snowden getaway options, academic interaction feynman diagrams, javascript's wake and false confidence in https"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/snowden-getaway-options-academic-interaction-feynman-diagrams-javascripts-wake-and-false-confidence-in-https.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-30T09:57:00+12:00</published><updated>2013-07-30T09:57:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-07-30:/snowden-getaway-options-academic-interaction-feynman-diagrams-javascripts-wake-and-false-confidence-in-https.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of movies, near the end of the hit film "Catch Me If You Can," there's a scene that Snowden might do well to watch while he's killing time in the airport lounge (or wherever he is) pondering his fate. The young forger, Frank Abagnale, who has been staying a step ahead of the feds, finally grows irritated and fatigued. Not because they are particularly skilled in their hunting, nor because they are getting closer, but simply because they won't give up. In a fit of pique, he blurts into the phone, "Stop chasing me!" On the other end, the dogged, bureaucratic Treasury agent, Carl Hanratty, answers, "I can't stop. It's my job."
Ultimately, this is why many people who have been involved in such matters believe Snowden will be caught.  ...
They'll have to make Edward Snowden their living, because those who are chasing him already have. Government agents will be paid every minute of every day for as long as it takes. Seasons may change and years may pass, but the odds say that one morning, he'll look out of a window, go for a walk or stop for a cup of coffee, and the trap will spring shut. It will be almost like a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is no JavaScript wake event. There is an online event, but it doesn’t seem to trigger whenever the computer is sent to sleep and re-awoken.
The only sure fire way I could work out to achieve this, was to run a interval and check that the it was invoked at the expected times. Any delay in an interval invocation indicates that the computer has just slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When "https is secure, make sure your bank uses https" permeates into the general conscience, does it become "if everything is https, everything is secure"? Does the prevalence of https inspire false confidence in the web or will people learn that https was never a good signal for determining the legitimacy of a (possibly forged) web site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last two weeks, I've been working on an audit project for an Android app. 
I worked on Microsoft's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE"&gt;WinCE&lt;/a&gt; about 14 years ago. 
I am quietly impressed by how developer friendly the Android platform is. Here are a couple of
shell scripts I have written to make the reverse engineering process easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our work, it is quite common to make some modification to the smali files 
generated by &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/"&gt;apktool&lt;/a&gt;, turn it back 
into a proper apk and install on the device to see whether our guesses were correct. 
This is quite a repetitive process that involves sign the apk, align the zip file, 
uninstall the original app and install the new one from local computer to the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pack.sh&lt;/code&gt; is a shell script that automates this process for you. It takes two parameters, 
the first is the folder where the smali files are; the second is the package name 
for the application, which is needed for us to automatically uninstalled the app from 
the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% gist 6073781 %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace"&gt;strace&lt;/a&gt; is a brilliant tool that allows you to 
attach to a running process and see all the unix system calls it's making. 
Once you get it up and running, it is almost trivial to get a comprehensive view 
of the app's interaction with Android system, for example, 
which files it touches, which urls it requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, the app would be launched and crashed immediately, leaving us no time
to manually attach a strace to the process to see what has gone wrong. &lt;code&gt;ambush.sh&lt;/code&gt;
is a shell script that waits for a process to show up and automatically attach strace
to that process. This makes it possible for us to see what the app has been doing 
before it crashes itself. It takes two parameters too. The first is the pattern 
that &lt;code&gt;ps | grep&lt;/code&gt; could use to find the process id; the latter is where the strace
is located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% gist 6034934 %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/18/android-runtime-strace"&gt;Benno&lt;/a&gt;
has compiled a version of &lt;a href="http://benno.id.au/android/strace"&gt;strace for Android&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have &lt;a href="www.busybox.net"&gt;busybox&lt;/a&gt; installed, you can run the following command 
to install it from the net. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p _="%" endcodeblock&gt;{% codeblock lang:bash %}
    $ cd /data/local
    $ wget http://benno.id.au/android/strace
    $ chmod 555 ./strace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that you'll have to put the strace in &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; in order to 
use &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; to make it an executable. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Browser fingerprint, randomness of hashing algorithm, rate limiting as meta-tool and KPI for local government"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/browser-fingerprint-randomness-of-hashing-algorithm-rate-limiting-as-meta-tool-and-kpi-for-local-government.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-22T22:58:00+12:00</published><updated>2013-07-22T22:58:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-07-22:/browser-fingerprint-randomness-of-hashing-algorithm-rate-limiting-as-meta-tool-and-kpi-for-local-government.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting is a technique, outlined in the research by Electronic Frontier Foundation, of anonymously identifying a web browser with accuracy of up to 94%.&lt;br&gt;
Browser is queried its agent string, screen color depth, language, installed plugins with supported mime types, timezone offset and other capabilities, such as local storage and session storage. Then these values are passed through a hashing function to produce a fingerprint that gives weak guarantees of uniqueness.&lt;br&gt;
No cookies are stored to identify a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked how little comprehensive information was out there on rate limiting and velocity checking for software developers, because they are your first and most important line of defense against a broad spectrum of possible attacks. It's amazing how many attacks you can mitigate or even defeat by instituting basic rate limiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Pixar movie is connected. I explain how, and possibly why. Several months ago, I watched a fun-filled video on Cracked.com that introduced the idea (at least to me) that all of the Pixar movies actually exist within the same universe. Since then, I’ve obsessed over this concept, working to complete what I call “The Pixar Theory,” a working narrative that ties all of the Pixar movies into one cohesive timeline with a main theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fundamental interactions behind our gadgets are designed to constantly lure us back into the four-inch world, nudging us with vibration, push notifications, and impromptu xylophone solos to almost touch all of the people in our lives doing the same thing on another four-inch screen somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/07/16/authentic-design/"&gt;Authentic Design&lt;/a&gt;: A good landscape overview to separate the concept of "flat design", "minimalist design" from "authenticity in design".  The author has done a good job guiding one through the history of design movements in the last two centuries.  I like his definition of authentic design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its desire for authenticity, the Modern design movement curbed the ornamental excess of the 19th century, making design fit the age of mass production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In late 19 century) The idea was to highlight beauty of form in objects that were purely functional. For the modern design movement, decoration was not necessary. Beauty and elegance were to emerge from the design of the content itself, not from a superficial coat of decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentic design is about using materials without masking them in fake textures, showcasing their strengths instead of trying to hide their weaknesses. Authentic design is about doing away with features that are included only to make a product appear familiar or desirable but that otherwise serve no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Its artless shape gave it a certain naive innocence that suggested authenticity, just as the early versions of the Land Rover had the kind of credibility that comes with a design based on a technically ingenious idea rather than the desire to create a seductive consumer product." --  Deyan Sudjic commented on the design of the iconic Anglepoise lamp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design whose beauty lies in function is not the same thing as minimalist style. With the former, the designer seeks to remove the superfluous, to make the product easier to understand, to make it perform better and to make the most of its medium. The latter seeks to create a minimalist aesthetic, to give the object an aura of simplicity and cleanliness. One is a fundamental principle of design, the other a stylistic choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake to rigidly apply a minimalist design aesthetic to an interface as a style in the hope of making the interface simpler and more digitally “authentic.” For example, ruthlessly eliminating visuals such as shadows, colors and varied background styles would not necessarily make an interface easier to use. In some cases, it would achieve the opposite by undermining hierarchy and focus, which were established by those very shadows and background colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/07/malware-hidden-inside-jpg-exif-headers.html"&gt;Malware Hidden Inside JPG EXIF Headers&lt;/a&gt;: I like PHP for its flexibility. You just modify a file and you're done. But with that flexibility comes with huge security risks. In fact the security holes in PHP has scared me away from wordpress into Jekyll.  This backdoor is possible because this strange decision to make a string replace be able to execute a file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;preg_replace has a hidden and tricky option where if you pass the “/e” modifier it will execute the content (eval), instead of just searching/replacing.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are the conclusions from the author: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do hit peak smart phone penetration, how might the app store dynamics change? It’s hard to know before it happens but here are a few thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited demand for applications should increase the average cost per install. This will drive developers to pursue apps with increasing monetization to support higher costs of acquisition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will have maturity in utility categories like email clients, phone clients, web browsers; some turnover in social networks; most turnover in games. Utilities tend to be downloaded by new users and infrequently replaced. But gamers swap out the next platformer as soon as they are bored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreasing attractiveness of the marginal smart phone user in terms of ARPUU. New smart phone users will increasingly live outside of the most developed markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never expected this to be hard. Sure it won't be difficult to do this in 2013. But after sinking almost 1 hour into this, I decided to write it down hoping that it might save other people a bit time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started with …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never expected this to be hard. Sure it won't be difficult to do this in 2013. But after sinking almost 1 hour into this, I decided to write it down hoping that it might save other people a bit time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started with &lt;a href="sox.sourceforge.net/"&gt;sox&lt;/a&gt;. I tried &lt;code&gt;sox zit.mp3 zit.ogg&lt;/code&gt; and received an error message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sox FAIL formats: no handler for file extension `ogg'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I tried &lt;code&gt;dir2ogg -q7 zit.mp3&lt;/code&gt; which was recommended by a post on Ubuntu's discussion forum. But unfortunately, it still didn't work out. Here is the error message I got: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dir2ogg 0.11.8 (2009-08-04), converts audio files into ogg vorbis.&lt;/p&gt;

}}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much fiddling around, this is the final solution that was working for me. To chain &lt;code&gt;mpg123&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;oggenc&lt;/code&gt; together. &lt;code&gt;mpg123&lt;/code&gt; will generate a &lt;code&gt;.wav&lt;/code&gt;  file to the standard output, which &lt;code&gt;oggenc&lt;/code&gt; takes in and emit a corresponding &lt;code&gt;ogg&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in *.mp3; do mpg321 $i -w - | oggenc -q7 -o ${i/mp3/ogg} -; done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few caveats: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$i&lt;/code&gt; is the filename and &lt;code&gt;${i/mp3/ogg}&lt;/code&gt; changes the output filename. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-q7&lt;/code&gt; select a level-7 sound quality. Since both mp3 and ogg are lossy sound format, converting one to another with the same sample rate would only decrease the sound quality. By specifying a higher bit rate, the &lt;code&gt;ogg&lt;/code&gt; output would sound similar to the &lt;code&gt;mp3&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; are quite important. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Ubuntu/Debian, you might need to install the packages using &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install mpg321 vorbis-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This makes farms more eco-friendly, say proponents of genetically modified (GM) crops, and GM seeds also allow farmers to spend less on “inputs” (chemicals), thereby making a greater profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a new study released by Food &amp;amp; Water Watch yesterday finds the goal of reduced chemical use has not panned out as planned.  In fact, according to the USDA and EPA data used in the report, the quick adoption of genetically engineered crops by farmers has increased herbicide use over the past 9 years in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both reports focus on “superweeds.” It turns out that spraying a pesticide repeatedly selects for weeds which also resist the chemical.  Ever more resistant weeds are then  bred, able to withstand increasing amounts – and often different forms – of herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of debate is the pesticide glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto Round Up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/"&gt;Apple has been burned by productivity apps before&lt;/a&gt;: An interesting theory but I am not sure I agree. I think Apple is strong enough to have walked out of its youth insecurity. But still a fascinating to read: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I just noted, the great thing about productivity apps is that they add value, and the more you use them, the more valuable they become – the potential value of a productivity app is limited only by the amount of data you are willing to put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble for Apple – or any platform provider – is apps that cross that line from nice-to-have to completely irreplaceable. It’s at that point a user’s loyalty shifts from platform to app, and there are no greater examples than the aforementioned Photoshop and Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/07/01/detecting-outliers/"&gt;Detecting Outlers&lt;/a&gt;: I love the sanddune metaphor and how much clearer a light layer of color adds to the graph. Nice data visualization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/information-and-order/"&gt;Information and Order&lt;/a&gt;: A fresh perspective of treating Gold as a low entropy device in the finance market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictability and order are notspontaneous and cannot be left to the invisible hand. It takes a low-entropy carrier (no surprises) to bear high-entropy information (full of surprisal). In capitalism, the predictable carriers are the rule of law, the maintenance of order, the defense of property rights, the reliability and restraint of regulation, the transparency of accounts, the stability of money, the discipline and futurity of family life, and a level of taxation commensurate with a modest and predictable role of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also from the &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/06/10/george-gilder-thankfully-returns-bearing-knowledge-and-power/"&gt;Forbes review&lt;/a&gt; of the same book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dodd-Frank&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal of financial reform should be to end this divorce between knowledge and power and ensure that most capital flows to the people who can wield it best, the entrepreneurs.  By contrast, the reform that was enacted, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, with 2,323 pages of bromides and legalese enhancing the power of regulators, moves in the opposite direction.  It increases the distance between the people in authority and the people with entrepreneurial knowledge.  It concentrates yet more power in the leviathans and their Treasury sponsors and Federal Reserve supervisors, and it imposes hundreds of new regulations on entrepreneurial finance.  Dodd-Frank sacrifices information on the altar of ignorant power.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On monetary policy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Could it be that the fundamental cause of the [2008 financial] crisis was that the monetary system, alone among the structures of capitalism, lacks a low-entropy physical layer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the centuries of monetary history, the remedy for unstable money has always been gold.  Critics who say the gold standard has been eclipsed by an information standard based on the Internet do not grasp the essence of information theory, which measures the information content by its ‘news’ (expressed in digital form as unexpected bits or entropy).  It takes a low-entropy carrier to bear a high-entropy newsworthy message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 130,000 metric tons of gold that has been mined in all of human history constitutes the supreme low-entropy carrier for the upside surprises of capitalism.  Without guidance from gold, currency markets are subject to political high entropy.  They resemble a communications system without a predictable carrier that enables the information to be distinguished from the noise in the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…Without a baseline of gold, entrepreneurship in the world economy degenerates into the manipulation of currencies for the interests of profiteers and government insiders.  This is a pathology of capitalism ….” (p. 122)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you told you that I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; the concept of &lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/will-bitcoin-follow-the-path-of-bittorrent/"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; yet? &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Will Bitcoin follow the path of BitTorrent?

&lt;li&gt;bestof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I love the concept of Bitcoin. I love a currency that's outside of the
the control of governments, or law enforcement agencies.  I love 
the built-in feature of fixed number of money supply.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I love the concept of Bitcoin. I love a currency that's outside of the
the control of governments, or law enforcement agencies.  I love 
the built-in feature of fixed number of money supply.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2004-06, I had similar feeling towards P2P technologies. 
I spent non-trivial amount of time reading BitTorrent's source code, following
the latest development in Distributed Hash Tables. By then, Skype was this shiny little
startup from Estonia that uses P2P to achieve significant call quality improvement with little cost.  However, almost
10 years later, P2P still hasn't been accepted by mainstream. Yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick landscape research on bitcoin recently. My feeling is that
it's still too early for us to know for sure what might come out of this experiment.  The smeared reputation as a currency for buying illegal goods, the extremely low usage of 
the currency and the government's cramp down all reminds me what has happened to 
BitTorrent and P2P technology could happen to Bitcoin as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion is Bitcoin is overvalued but it will stay high as long as US keeps printing its dollar and China keeps loaning money to the US. This does not mean Bitcoin has a bright future though unless the mainstream starts to accept it as a currency for transactions.  Here are four good links I have found on this topic. Go reading them and form your own opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/trends/bitcoin-industrystartups"&gt;Bitcoin Industry Sees More Investors than Startups&lt;/a&gt;: The increase
of Bitcoin value seems to be a result of traditional money diversifying their "portfolio"
instead of driven up by real usage. (via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein"&gt;@joshuabrustein&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With deal activity shooting up in Q2’13 as the graph below illustrates, there are currently more venture capital and angel investors interested in the Bitcoin space than there are actual investor-backed startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/how-the-bitcoin-1-manipulate-the-currency-deceive-its-user-community-and-make-its-future-uncertain/2013/06/30"&gt;How the Bitcoin 1% manipulate the currency, deceive its user community, and make its future uncertain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that almost all these large transactions were the descendants of a single large transaction involving 90,000 Bitcoins which took place on November 8th 2010, and that the subgraph of these transactions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of temporary intermediate accounts, or split into many small amounts which are sent to different accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into essentially the same amount in a new account.” (source: Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph.)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68438.0"&gt;Topic: Current Bitcoins in "circulation"&lt;/a&gt;: Due to the nature of Bitcoin and how many people hold it instead of using it, it is not surprising to see that it's hard to come up with an accurate circulation number.  I don't treat this as either good or bad though.  It's this inevitable nature of Bitcoin that might surprise normal people who are used to the concept of Central Banks and controlled number of money in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have a million BTC in an address that hasn't been touched for 2 years, and then add 10 BTC to it today.  That shouldn't add a million and ten to the "in circulation" number; it should just add 10 BTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/bitcoin-bits.html"&gt;Bitcoin Bits and the market&lt;/a&gt;: Don't call me a Bitcoin critics because I am not. I want it to succeed. It is spirit lifting to see a real world market where goods can only be bought using Bitcoin.  Usage is the oxygen to ideas. I don't believe in any other alternative ways for bitcoin to gain momentum except to have more markets like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly an "open air market". Folks were buying and selling Bitcoin for cash. You'd hand someone the cash and they would take out their phone and send you the Bitcoin in a mobile wallet to mobile wallet transaction. I also bought a Bitcoin t-shirt using Bitcoin sent from my mobile wallet.
There is something real and tangible about an open air market where the only currency allowed is Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing this article, &lt;a href="http://corte.si"&gt;Aldo Cortesi&lt;/a&gt; gave a valuable comment on how Bitcoin is compared to P2P technology on usability and mainstream's inertia: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think P2P never caught on because a) it was never very convenient for the user, and b) it was stigmatized due to transfer of illegal/pirated content.
Structurally, Bitcoin has a better chance of actually solving some long-standing, existing user convenience issues. But its stigma problem is even greater than p2p, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you decide to reply to a reviewer, several principles always apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be polite. Lashing out at a negative reviewer is not going to change their opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be conciliatory. If a reviewer is wrong, don't say they're wrong. Say "there seems to be a misunderstanding." If the misunderstanding arose from poor presentation, admit it and offer to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be thorough. Don't dodge any points or refuse to answer any questions. If the reviewers found a flaw, admit the flaw and offer a fix (if you can find one).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And there are Lisp, which is expressive enough to be used as a DSL to generate code for high performance systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Specific Language Compilers and various other tools written in Common Lisp. [...] on 10Gb/s Ethernet market data packets coming from exchanges like the NASDAQ we process the IP/UDP/multicast network stack, extract the messages from the packets, parse/decode/filter/normalize those messages, maintain the indexed order book data structures, aggregate the price levels per stock, generate output messages and finally send them to a server through PCI-express or 10Gb/s Ethernet network stacks. The nice thing is that we do all that fully pipelined at a rate of one message every 12 nanoseconds! To have an idea of how fast it is, in 12 ns the light will only travel 3.6 meters (11.8 ft). Another way to view this performance is that the system can process 83 Millions of financial messages per second without any queuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968822"&gt;The future of blogging platform is ... a linking service&lt;/a&gt;:  Well said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying value proposition by any sort of blogging engine (Posthaven, Medium, Svbtle, et al) is limited to a network, ease of use, and a good design. For most tech people, ease of use is a non-factor (you can extol 'distractions-free design', but you can put vim or Byword in full-screen mode) -- and I think the way people are reading is shifting away from individual sites and towards external services to the extent that design isn't a huge factor (everything looks the same in NewsBlur or Instapaper.)
[...]
I can't help thinking that the winner of this nouveau publishing spectrum isn't going to be a hosting service, but a linking service. You might never get Patrick McKenzie to blog on your platform (because why would he?) but you can always link to his material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/technology-we-can-change-our-leadership-or-we-can-quit/"&gt;Technology: we can change our leadership, or we can quit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has lost its “golden child” image, with piñatas of Google buses being beaten to shit in San Francisco, invasions of privacy making national headlines, and an overall sense in the country that our leadership’s exceptionalist reputation as the “good” nouveau riche is not deserved and must end. To put it bluntly, the rest of the country doesn’t like us– any of us– anymore. We’ve lost that good faith, in technology, that allowed us to be rich (well, a few of us) and not hated, even in the midst of a transformational, generation-eating recession. 2013 will be remembered as the year when popular opinion of “Silicon Valley” imploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that entrepreneurs keep the funding amounts small in the early rounds when the valuations are lower and then scale up the amounts in the later rounds when it is a lot more clear how money can create value and when the valuations will be higher. This model has worked out pretty well. David Karp raised $600k, then $4mm, then 5mm, then $25mm, then $80mm (or something like that). And at the time of the sale to Yahoo!, he owned a very nice stake in the business even though he had raised well north of $100mm. He did that by keeping his rounds small in the early days and only scaling them when he had to and the valuations offered were much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/look-what-i-made/58f85583d843"&gt;A Stage Coach To The Stars&lt;/a&gt;: This article discussed the idea of building a spacecoach, a fully reusable interplanetary spacecraft whose mass is mostly water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that water is highly desirable in an interplanetary spacecraft, not just for life support (for people and plants), but can be used for many purposes on a long flight, including radiation shielding (its comparable to lead on a per kilogram basis), thermal regulation (its an excellent heat sink), oxygen generation (via electrolysis), attitude control (by pumping water around ring shaped reservoirs) and propulsion (water vapor can be heated to very high temperatures in microwave electrothermal engines to produce thrust several times more efficiently than chemical rockets). Water is also easy to handle, meaning the craft can be resupplied as needed, something that is much more difficult to do with chemical rocket fuels, especially cryogenic fuels.

None of this is to say that this would be easy to do, but the technology needed to build these ships exists and improves with each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/HashSharingSystem"&gt;Hash-Sharing Systems&lt;/a&gt;: collaborative spam fighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the approaches used to identify spam goes like this; if I see a spam message at 8:30 in the morning, I send a checksum of that message to an online database of spam. When you get that message a little later on in the morning, your mail system asks that online database, "Has anyone reported this as spam?". The online database can report back "yes", allowing your mail system to raise the spam score for that message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.tutorspree.com/post/54349646327/death-of-organic-search"&gt;How Google is Killing Organic Search&lt;/a&gt;: The claim might be a bit hyperbole but I have been surprised by these changes recently. The perceived quality of Google search result &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13%: That’s the amount of real estate given to true organic results in a search for “auto mechanic" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7%: That’s the amount of on page real estate that the newest iteration of Google gives to organic results on a search for “Italian Restaurant"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0%: Open your iPhone. Search for “Italian Food." What do you see? If you’re in NYC, you see 0 organic results. You see an ad unit taking half the page, and then a Google owned Zagat listing. Start scrolling, you’ll see a map, then Google local listings. After four full page scrolls, you’ll have the organic listings in front of you.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/06/19/kierkegaard-on-anxiety-and-creativity/"&gt;Kierkegaard on Anxiety &amp;amp; Creativity&lt;/a&gt;. 
Søren Kierkegaard argues like anxiety comes naturally with the ability to create. Anxiety often triggers another emotion guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rollo May dived into the guilty part deeper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;creating also means destroying the status quo of one’s environment, breaking the old forms; it means producing something new and original in human relations as well as in cultural forms (e.g., the creativity of the artist). Thus every experience of creativity has its potentiality of aggression or denial toward other persons in one’s environment or established patterns within one’s self. 
The more creative the person, he held, the more anxiety and guilt are potentially present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/business/media/journalism-is-still-at-work-even-when-its-practitioner-has-a-slant.html?smid=tw-share&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;Journalism, Even When It’s Tilted&lt;/a&gt;: So now I know that activist is another word that can be used to smear people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a journalist and activist, Mr. Greenwald could not resist a jab. “I have seen all sorts of so-called objective journalists who have all kinds of assumptions in every sentence they write,” he said. “Rather than serve as an adversary of government, they want to bolster the credibility of those in power. That is a classic case of a certain kind of activism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Westerners, we believe in pushing up against the limits, and going over them: we’re pedal to the metal, giving 110%, and our amps go to 11. We max ourselves out in every facet of our lives: our finances, our relationships, our health, and our careers. ... The problem with being maxed out is you can’t deal with anything new. I couldn’t fit anything else in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/12/money/"&gt;Making Money on the Web: Ads versus Paywall&lt;/a&gt; A rare glimpse into how much money a pro-blogger makes. Hint, not a lot. 
Ad supported: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made on average $2,100 a month. My stats were 50,000 uniques and 150,000 page views a month with 8,200 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paywall and the $40/year membership fee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how many members do I have? Roughly 255 right now. Again, I don’t know if that is good or horrible. It amounts to a little less than $1,000 a month after fees and such. So less than half of what I was making before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will he keeps on having the paywall? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve learned is that the member base is very stable. That I barely gain new members each month, and likely if I want to up the membership I will need to talk about the membership more. Since putting up the paywall I’ve been able to stop caring about stats and money. All I focus on is writing and that’s way better. Yes there is a little bit of support, but far less than the work it took to fill RSS slots, or mentally think about keeping up page views to try and get better ad rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always slightly humorous to see people congratulated for raising capital. It’s like clapping the pilot of a plane for successfully refuelling before take-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://henryr.github.io/cap-faq/"&gt;The CAP FAQ&lt;/a&gt;: CAP is one of those fundamental concept I hope more engineers understand, no matter which kind of database technology you use.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/06/19/frequency-trails/"&gt;Frequency Trails&lt;/a&gt;: What's fascinating about this is the comparison with heatmap and the affordance of color and line in data visualization tasks. &lt;em&gt;Frequency trails are [...] developed to study the finer details of hundreds of measured latency distributions from production servers, and in particular, to study latency outliers. ... Frequency trails use height to show the frequency of data rather than color, and provide higher resolution for outliers. Subtle details can be more easily seen by small variations in height, rather than small variations in color saturation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://chomsky.info/interviews/20130528.htm"&gt;The Kind of Anarchism I Believe in, and What's Wrong with Libertarians&lt;/a&gt;: I like and respect Chomsky but I am suspicious of anything that can be summarized into a word ends with an -ism.  &lt;em&gt;anarchism [...] is a tendency that is suspicious and skeptical of domination, authority, and hierarchy. It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified. It assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them. Their authority is not self-justifying. They have to give a reason for it, a justification. And if they can't justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just. ... Well what's called libertarian in the United States, which is a special U. S. phenomenon, it doesn't really exist anywhere else -- a little bit in England -- permits a very high level of authority and domination but in the hands of private power: so private power should be unleashed to do whatever it likes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

JavaScript should win; Dart is bad! But then I came to realize the Dart guys aren’t just setting out to improve the authoring and scalability of web application development. They also really want the web to win. Now I’ve recently spoke about how The Mobile Web Is In Trouble, and clarified that my priorities are seeing it provide a fantastic user experience to everyone. For me, seeing the mobile web be successful trumps language wars and certainly quibbling over syntax. So I’m happy to see developers embrace the authoring advantages of Coffeescript, the smart subset of JavaScript strict mode, the legendary Emscripten &amp;amp; asm.js combo, the compiler feedback of TypeScript and the performance ambitions of Dart. It’s worth trying out technologies that can leapfrog the current expectations of the user experience that we can deliver. Our web is worth it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The algorithm to induce a random forest will create a bunch of random decision trees automatically. Since the trees are generated at random, most won't be all that meaningful to learning your classification/regression problem (maybe 99.9% of trees). Simply, the 99.9% of trees that are irrelevant make predictions that are all over the map and cancel each another out. The predictions of the minority of trees that are good top that noise and yield a good prediction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/"&gt;I said&lt;/a&gt;, I feel let down by the iOS 7 design.  It is not that Apple won't be able to get the contrasts right or they can't nail the design details. It is not that this does not open up a whole new trend of design that focuses on content, which I agree is a good thing. It is about what is Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/"&gt;Designed by Apple&lt;/a&gt; is fine. I love Apple's product because they are beautiful and such a joy to use.

Macintosh made it possible for normal people to run VisiCalc at home.  iPhone offered GPS and high-def camera which enabled a whole range of innovations/industries. These are the things I am looking for on a technology platform provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following comment from HackerNews summarized my thoughts perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay change for change's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the wrong attitude in my opinion. How does it help users to all of a sudden have most apps feel ancient? Is it really something to be proud of? That for the next year we'll be working on replacing existing utilities so that they feel "right" and "fresh" instead of doing what we should be doing: thinking of actual new software that is worthwhile to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been saying this for a while but I think what is happening, and what many developers haven't noticed yet, is that we have exhausted the utility of software for software's sake. The interesting stuff happening in mobile now has nothing to do with "design" in the traditional sense any more. Its not enough to just have a coder and a designer on the team. The really cool stuff is all about what your phone actually allows you to do in the real world. Look at apps like uber, postmates, spotify, and twitch.tv. Most of these have terrible UI's, but that's not the point. The point is that they allow you to do things. I can have a car on my doorstep! I can listen to almost any song I want. They're not just another calculator app or news reader, so who cares if its not the prettiest or easiest thing to use in the world. They are an interface to actually useful services. Software was interesting on its own a decade ago, but the industry has grown up, its time to do things now. That doesn't mean that "UI and UX" don't matter, it just means their definition changes and grows beyond just how you tap things on glass and what pixels you choose to animate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that iOS 7 seems comforting in the way its described in this article is because it gives developers who haven't realized this something to do again. Marco is absolutely right, for a long time it has felt like all the major categories have been covered on the app store. That's a good thing! It means we've solved lots of problems. We shouldn't daydream of a day when those problems get artificially unsolved so we can have another shot at them. We should move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the present - it pains me to see such a lack of transparency in how our elected officials are running our government. Of course, the common man knows it's common sense that there's an inherent need for secrecy in conducting small scale covert operations. We do get it.
However, it's also common sense that it's inevitable that any complex large-scale long-term operation will ultimately come to light. And so it's just common sense that any such broad-based operations that might be perceived as impacting our constitutional rights should be the subject of broad public debate. No, not when they're being prototyped or tested or used in small scale settings - but definitely somewhere on the path from "tactical use" to "broad strategic dependence".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not small issues, nor need they be at all partisan. Wyden, Paul, and others are trying. Theses issues are fundamental to defining the relationship between us citizens and our government in the decades ahead.
In particular, in this world where "SaaS" and "software eats everything" and "cloud computing" and "big data" are inevitable and already pervasive, it pains me to see how 3rd Party Doctrine may now already be being leveraged to effectively gut the intent of U.S. citizens' Fourth Amendment rights. Don't we need a common-sense refresh to the wording of our laws and potentially our constitution as it pertains to how we now rely upon 3rd parties? It makes zero sense in a "services age" where granting third parties limited rights to our private information is so basic and fundamental to how we think, work, conduct and enjoy life.
For example, did you really intend to yield your 4th amendment rights when you granted a 3rd party access to your files as a part of Mac Software Update, Windows Update, Virus Scanners, etc., or when you started using a service-tethered smartphone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, unlike 'web tracking' issues which seem to be broadly ignored because of our love for ad-supported services, I hope we all (especially the young readers of reddit, hackernews, etc) wake up to the fact that these privacy and transparency issues are REAL, and that they truly will impact you and the country you live in, and that even if you don't consider yourself an activist you really should get informed and form an opinion. Again, this is a non-partisan issue, and let's all work to ensure that it stays this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two great organizations where you can learn are EPIC and EFF. (Disclosure: I am on the board of EPIC.) Take it in, and think. Your contributions are needed and would of course be quite welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted the link on Google's new photo search and how "deep learning" makes that possible.  Here are some weekend reads on this topic.  The two videos focusing on different aspect of this concept. The first one explains the concept and the implication. The second talk covers how to use a large distributed computing model to train the multiple layers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"&gt;What is Deep learning&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Deep learning is set of algorithms in machine learning that attempt to learn layered models of inputs, commonly neural networks. The layers in such models correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where higher-level concepts are defined from lower-level ones, and the same lower-level concepts can help to define many higher-level concepts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2538"&gt;Deep learning - The Biggest Data Science Breakthrough of the Decade&lt;/a&gt; (60m video): This one talks more about the historical context and the Kaggle machine learning platform. Not particularly technically challenging but interesting enough since it provides lots of the applications of this technology. &lt;em&gt;Machine learning and AI have appeared on the front page of the New York Times three times in recent memory: 1) When a computer beat the world's #1 chess player 2) When Watson beat the world's best Jeopardy players 3) When deep learning algorithms won a chemo-informatics Kaggle competition. We all know about the first two... but what's that deep learning thing about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/52332329"&gt;Tera-scale deep learning - Quoc V. Le&lt;/a&gt; (60m video): &lt;em&gt;Deep learning and unsupervised feature learning offer the potential to transform many domains such as vision, speech, and NLP. However, these methods have been fundamentally limited by our computational abilities, and typically applied to small-sized problems. In this talk, I describe the key ideas that enabled scaling deep learning algorithms to train a very large model on a cluster of 16,000 CPU cores (2000 machines). This network has 1.15 billion parameters, which is more than 100x larger than the next largest network reported in the literature.&lt;/em&gt; (via: &lt;a href="http://datascience101.wordpress.com"&gt;data science 101&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Google photo search break-through, Linkin's MonitorRank, Apple's Picasso-style design and On-demand music touring"</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/google-photo-search-break-through-linkins-monitorrank-apples-picasso-style-design-and-on-demand-music-touring.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-13T17:11:00+12:00</published><updated>2013-06-13T17:11:00+12:00</updated><author><name>Alex Dong &lt;me@alexdong.com&gt;</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-06-13:/google-photo-search-break-through-linkins-monitorrank-apples-picasso-style-design-and-on-demand-music-touring.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- links&lt;/h2&gt;

A modern website is usually composed of hundreds of services running on thousands of machines in multiple data centers. This paper introduces MonitorRank, an algorithm that can reduce the time, domain knowledge, and human effort required to find the root causes of anomalies in such service-oriented architectures. In the event of an anomaly, MonitorRank provides a ranked order list of possible root causes for monitoring teams to investigate. MonitorRank uses the historical and current time-series metrics of each sensor as its input, along with the call graph generated between sensors to build an unsupervised model for ranking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vintagemacmuseum.com/the-enduring-appeal-of-macintosh-picasso-artwork/"&gt;The Enduring Appeal of Macintosh Picasso Artwork&lt;/a&gt;: I am happily surprised to see that even as early as 1984, Steve Jobs has already got a strong, long lasting and consistent brand image nailed. This is used all the way into mid 1990s. &lt;em&gt;The famous Macintosh Picasso logo was developed for the introduction of the original 128k Mac back in 1984. A minimalist line drawing in the style of Pablo Picasso, this whimsical graphic implied the whole of a computer in a few simple strokes. It was an icon of what was inside the box, and became as famous as the computer it represented. It’s been beloved ever since, and the graphic style has endured across decades.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you are looking for polarized rants as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, this  is not for you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you are looking for polarized rants as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, this  is not for you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Apple. Before Apple, design was a luxury item that quite often was left to the last stage of product development. After Apple, it has become a top priority.  As an engineer with 15 years training in calligraphy, I feel grateful that Apple has lifted the public's taste for good design.  I don't think I am an Apple fanboy. I am just someone who gets a bit too easily annoyed by bad designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have to say &lt;strong&gt;I am a bit let down by the new iOS 7&lt;sup id="fnref:ContextOfDiscussion"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContextOfDiscussion" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Yes, it is a totally new direction for iOS. Apple needs a few iterations to consolidate and refine the design language. Yes, each product needs time to catch up with the new direction. And yes, it takes efforts and compromises to provide a smooth migration path between the old and the new.  There are many reasons I can use to justify why Apple released these products at the current stage. However deep in my heart  &lt;strong&gt;I worry that I might lose yet another company I love and respect &lt;sup id="fnref:CompaniesIRespect"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CompaniesIRespect" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, there are some very well designed apps. Like Clock, Weather&lt;sup id="fnref:ContrastOfWeather"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContrastOfWeather" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Compass. These designs have nothing loose or left unsettled.  Whitespace ample and balanced. Functions laid out clearly. No surprise. No guess work. Everything is where they should be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Well designed apps" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do keep in mind though that there are little design-tech-feature tensions here though. The feature sets of these apps are well defined so it's mainly a design exercise. So these are the easy ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we get over simple ones, I start to see inconsistent metaphors.  For example, here are 3 apps all offering the ability to select media from a library. I am particularly perplexed by the newsstand app. On one hand, its "store" sits on the bottom "frosted glass" toolbar, which is kind of new metaphor. On the other hand, it seems to carry with it the old skeuomorphism of a physical magazine stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another example. There are 2 ways to select from a range of screens. The left is the new "look-down" view on a list of open tabs in Safari. Flip up-and-down to navigation, click the small x on top right corner to delete. The right one is the new screen manager. Flip left-to-right to navigate, swipe to the top to close one.  I'm not sure why Apple releases two totally new yet visually so different ways for the same task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tab selection metaphor" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the inconsistent metaphors, I have to admit that I feel the new "simplified" interface maybe have gone a bit too far in some apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logos feel a bit "too simple". They &lt;strong&gt;feel like the Apple logo without the bite&lt;/strong&gt;.  The naughtiness has disappeared. Checkout the logos on the right of the "Contact detail" page and the ones in Safari browser's toolbar. I am sure we'll have no problem finding and using those buttons to perform the tasks but somehow I am left to want a bit more. I want "that bite". I want some personality. Something beyond a sleek and minimal design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two answer incoming call interfaces below left wondering &lt;strong&gt;whether the "slide to answer" new design is a bit too clever&lt;/strong&gt;.  One the left, the green square is clearly a button. Click to answer.  On the right though, the same green square requires a "slide".  It looks like a light will slide across the surface to indicate an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance"&gt;affordance&lt;/a&gt; to "slide", but maybe it is a bit too subtle? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slide to answer" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I genuinely hope that all these shortcomings are either deliberate design compromises&lt;sup id="fnref:IAmNoDesigner"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:IAmNoDesigner" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or Apple is well on its path to fix them, as in all 1.0 products.  The next year or two will be crucial. The best case scenario is the company lifts itself to a new solid ground for another 5-10 years solid growth.  The worst case is that the company fails to consolidate and the gaps get wider and scarier. We'll have to wait and see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:CompaniesIRespect"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google are the two companies I used to like and respect. Microsoft has being enjoying a quiet long death whereas Google has become a &lt;a href="http://corte.si/posts/socialmedia/rip-google-reader.html"&gt;destroyer of ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:CompaniesIRespect" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ContextOfDiscussion"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now since I'm looking at these logos out of their designed context, I might feel different when I use the physical device.  There are just too many steps we can project our own thoughts into screenshots.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ContextOfDiscussion" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ContrastOfWeather"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some words being &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5856590"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; about the contrast of the app. I'll have to wait to see the screen on a real device to give my own judgement here.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ContrastOfWeather" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:IAmNoDesigner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, Jonny is the one who has done so many amazing designs. Based on pure probability, I have a higher chance to be proven wrong.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:IAmNoDesigner" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/StandingOvation.MillerPage.pdf"&gt;Standing Ovation Problem&lt;/a&gt; is a social science model that is extremely simple yet "provides a rich domain to explore the world".  Here is how a SOP is defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brilliant economics lecture ends and the audience begins to applaud. The applause builds and tentatively, a few audience members may or may not decide to stand. Does a standing ovation ensue or does the enthusiasm fizzle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch Scott explains the theory in this &lt;a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking-2012-002/lecture/11"&gt;18-minutes video&lt;/a&gt; but here is the gist of the theory. The following 6 factors have a strong impact on whether a standing ovation happens or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower Threshold: how easy the audiences are to be satisfied. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger Peer Effects: how likely the audiences are influenced by each other. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More variation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use celebrities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big groups. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three are self explainable and in most cases out of our control. What's more fascinating are 4-6. Let's dive into each one a bit more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;more variation&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's say there are two groups. Each group has 6 people. Here is the number of other people who has to stand up before one stand up: &lt;code&gt;(1, 1, 1,  2, 2, 2)&lt;/code&gt;. This basically says that for three people in the group, if they see one person stand up, they will stand up. The other three needs two people. Say we have a second group like this &lt;code&gt;(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means the person will stand up no matter how others behave and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; means that dude is really reluctant to change his body position unless almost everyone is doing it. Which one of these two groups will be more likely to pull a standing ovation? Yes, the second one even though it has a difficulty score of &lt;code&gt;2.5&lt;/code&gt; whereas the first group has only &lt;code&gt;1.5&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference? The second group has a more varied group so that a cascading effect can happen; also it has the &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.html"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; guy. Without any of these two factors, getting the second group to all stand up would be hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;use celebrities&lt;/strong&gt;.  The model uses celebrities to describe the people sitting at the front rows. They are not necessarily celebrities per se but they share the same traits which is they can't see other people's behavior yet everyone else can see theirs.  This gives them the power as 'magnifiers'.  &lt;sup id="fnref:Academics"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Academics" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;strong&gt;big groups&lt;/strong&gt;.  If people come in groups, let's say the wife stands up, there is a pretty high chance that the husband would get his bum up.  If we have an audience like this one: &lt;code&gt;{1: 0%, 2: 30%, 3: 30%, 4: 20%, 5: 10%, 6: 10%}&lt;/code&gt;, which is a group that's hard to please. Having a couple to stand up would be sufficient to &lt;em&gt;tip&lt;/em&gt; the whole audience over even if no one would stand up without two other people do it before them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply this theory to user acquisition is a fun exercise. If we have a software product that makes it really easy for people to have a link blog&lt;sup id="fnref:WeAreBuildingOne"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:WeAreBuildingOne" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, basically to share interesting links in the form of a blog like &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/"&gt;DaringFireball&lt;/a&gt;, here is a list of things that could be done to help getting new user sign ups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides getting onto the radar of big social news sites, finding many topic niches where people tie closely together would be important too. Say targeting niches where there is at least a forum for people to hang out. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups with larger peer effects would be the natural candidates. These are the groups where people pays lots of attention to each other and eager to jump onto the new bandwagon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each group, find out who are the celebrities and get them to use the service first. Then we can go after the other group members by leveraging the first batch of 'celebrities'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:Academics"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people sit in the last role is defined as academics, which I find quite funny. The nature of the academics is that they can see everyone yet no one can see them. Which means that they have the perfect information yet zero influence.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Academics" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, I would read an article and found myself
keeps nodding my head.  Alex Payne's recent post &lt;a href="http://al3x.net/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-young-programmer.html"&gt;A letter to a young programmer&lt;/a&gt; is such a gem.

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, I would read an article and found myself
keeps nodding my head.  Alex Payne's recent post &lt;a href="http://al3x.net/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-young-programmer.html"&gt;A letter to a young programmer&lt;/a&gt; is such a gem.
For quite a while, I have wanted to write about the four common myths about startup. 
Alex has managed to cover all of them. So here is my attempt to tell the same story
from my own perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Startup means working on brand new things. &lt;/strong&gt;  Actually the startup world is 
full of people moving in herds. Majority of the times you will be working on 
projects that are applying existing knowledge to solve new problems. 
People who are doing never-seen-before stuff might have problems to get
attractions. Sure you have watched this video Pinterest's 
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGgyma8cALQ"&gt;Ben gave at YC Startup School 2012&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are portrayed as an exciting, risky, even subversive alternative to
traditional corporate work. ... the culture of most startups is blandly uniform,
right down to a style of dress and grooming that helps “startup guys” – and all
too often are they guys – stay with their herd &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Working for startups are glamorous and always fun. &lt;/strong&gt;.  One advice I often give 
to job seekers is to look for the words a job posting uses. If there are
an excessive usage of "fun", "exciting", be careful.  These could be cheap tricks 
like feeding baby candies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the company-provided keg runs dry, the free lunches are making you fat, and
playing the Xbox in the break room is no longer as fun as it used to be, what then?
When you find that you now report to a politicking middle manager and not the
inspiring CEO who interviewed you, will you still want to be there? Is a supposedly
novel working environment enough to sustain you? When everywhere you might consider
working looks more or less the same, is the novelty even there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. If you follow the lean methodology, you'll win. &lt;/strong&gt; People say that my eyes start 
to roll over when I hear "lean", "MVP" or "agile". It is not that I don't think these 
are right ideas. Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it's a sin to expand the team 
if you haven't figured out your business model, user acquisition channel and costs yet. 
However, there are so much more than simply reparaphrasing the sentences in 
"Lean Startup" or "4-steps to Epiphany".  Startup is essentially a walk in the dark. 
You have to &lt;strong&gt;feel your ways&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;use your own judgement&lt;/strong&gt; a lot. And no surprisingly 
the judgements get honed only when you make mistakes. Quite often, the more painful it
hurts, the better you learned. Reading 10 books wouldn't help a bit because you're
always interpretating the text from the old perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups have been systematized, mythologized, culturally and socially de-risked;
reduced down to formulas and recipes. Yet, there is no enduring formula for
creativity and rebellion. When we attempt to factory farm innovation we breed out
the very thing we’re trying raise: the creative destruction that stokes and
re-stokes the fire of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Startup means working your ass off and say goodbye to personal life. &lt;/strong&gt;
Bragging of "macho heroics" of pulling a all-nightter will only make one look
naive. I'll still do it if the server goes down or there are some &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; deadlines 
I have to make. But I no longer do it because it makes me feel good. 
I've done plenty of those 36-hour non-stop coding thing and now looking back, I feel 
sorry for my younger self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups appeal to a desire for daring that’s lost in many forms of modern work, and
we’re told stories of the rewards waiting when personal lives are sacrificed on the
altar of the launch schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarily, if you meet me on the street and ask "are you busy", I will be
very hesitated to say I am. Being busy is the same way to admit 
that I fail to use my judgement to prioritize things, or I am unable to leverage 
the resources I have, or I seriously underestimate the work required, or I didn't 
code things up properly that I haven't been caught off guard by some accidents, or,
worst of all, I forgot about the whole point of why I started companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen firsthand the damage that startups can
do to relationships. I’ve watched marriages and friendships fall apart, seen
children and partners pushed aside, and failed those in my life in all kinds of ways
when work came to the fore. I’ve listened as people who are the very picture of
startup success – visible in the press and social media, headlining conferences,
forever founding and exiting – have confided their utter loneliness despite
being seemingly at the social center of the entrepreneurial community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working 14 years now. Half of which I worked for corporates, half I 
built startups.  Having said all these, I'd like to say that I enjoy working on
startups because &lt;strong&gt;it's the best way to understand and improve oneself&lt;/strong&gt;. 
When there is no room for
&lt;a href="http://au.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-on-the-difference-between-a-vice-president-and-a-janitor-2011-5"&gt;execuses&lt;/a&gt;, feedback loops start to run faster and one
benefits the most.  It's still the most rewarding experience, as long as
we get the expectations right. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Startup = growth * quality '</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/startup-equals-to-growth-quality.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-24T16:46:46+12:00</published><updated>2013-05-24T16:46:46+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-05-24:/startup-equals-to-growth-quality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important job as a founder is to build a healthy growth-quality ratio into the company's culture. A startup with great software but small number of users has only modest success. A company enjoying a dominate market share with poor quality products will gradually see its users …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important job as a founder is to build a healthy growth-quality ratio into the company's culture. A startup with great software but small number of users has only modest success. A company enjoying a dominate market share with poor quality products will gradually see its users shifting away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a businessman's perspective, quality is only one of many factors that determines whether the company will succeed. The quality needs to be good, but not necessarily great. The quality should be good enough so that the &lt;a href="http://www.ericsink.com/Act_Your_Age.html"&gt;middle of the bell curve&lt;/a&gt; is happy. Any further investment in quality is a waste of opportunities. Market share growth can fix quality problems because the company will have time to go back and refine the product. Microsoft and Cisco are two companies who are famous for their continuous improvement approach. They would bombard a new industry with shitty 1.0 products and then keep releasing better quality every release. PG's essay on &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html"&gt;startup = growth&lt;/a&gt; is a good argument for this point of view &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a craftsman's perspective, quality is the most important factor.  Growth is the natural next step. If you build an excellent product, people will come &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The product will &lt;a href="http://www.mintel.com/blog/new-market-trends/good-product-mostly-sells-itself-good-product-doesnt-need-excessive-marketing"&gt;mostly sell itself&lt;/a&gt;. It will help you to focus on doing what you're really good at. The craftsman's reputation would accumulate slowly over the years and this "branding" will gradually deliver a very nice compound interest &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 37signals' products are great but not 100 times better than their competitors. It is their reputation from RoR and the clear &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/rework"&gt;stance&lt;/a&gt; that catapult them to such a high level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is naive to say one approach is better than the other. Although given the constraints of resources, startups usually have to pick one at the cost of the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best companies are the ones who have an excellent and healthy execution on both growth and quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has a few products that are good enough to be &lt;a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=22559"&gt;collected by MOMA&lt;/a&gt;, yet its quarter-by-quarter growth has given it a tremendous scale advantage to build a highly optimized supply-chain.  When people says "if it weren’t for Tim Cook, the &lt;a href="http://au.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3?nr_email_referer=1"&gt;iPad would cost $5,000&lt;/a&gt;", they really meant that it's the growth that allows Apple to cut down their cost that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a artistic software craftsman, this is a reminder to myself to have more businessman's view in our company.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's keep it simple and assume that the product is what the market wants.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his interview &lt;a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/blog/david-h-hansson-partner-at-37signals-twist-e337.html"&gt;TWIS#E337&lt;/a&gt;, DHH mentioned that 37signals never had a hockey stick growth curve. Instead, they just "enjoy a year-to-year growth greater than inflation".&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good article but as a 3rd time entrepreneur, I have a significant different view on this. The essay is looking at startups from an investor perspective. It ruthlessly optimizes the efficiency of the whole ecosystem instead of focusing on individual's happiness. It is happiness that I'm optimizing for.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service, which was already pretty darn slick, is now among the most attractive and engaging web apps I’ve ever seen. ... it (Google+) now has its own style and signature features. ... It’s fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It's not. &lt;strong&gt;It sacrifices the usability of the product in exchange of a superficial look of pretty.&lt;/strong&gt;  The design stands in the way of presenting the content.  It is easy to whip up a "beautiful" page by throwing together some nice fonts and high quality pictures.  But engaging? Fun to use? I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the three major problems I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;images are out-of-proportionally big.  They steal the attention away from the texts.&lt;/strong&gt; Here is the &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/explore"&gt;What's Hot&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image too overwhelming" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming2.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty because of the two high quality photos which have taken up the majority of screen real estate.  You eyes will inevitably look at Larry's face and the new Android Studio but did you notice much of the text at all? Did you realize that Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA? (That news is, in my opinion, probably the most important and positive one for the Android developer community.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I get if I hide all the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming-no-image-.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image too overwhelming no image-" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Image-too-overwhelming-no-image-.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the text content better? Do you realize how huge those images were?  Sure this can't be a good design unless Google+ wants to become the next pinterest clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second problem is that the reading experience is weakened even further by endless demands for actions.&lt;/strong&gt;  Google+ constantly asks you to do things. Lots of them.  Now, go ahead and count how many actions you are suppose to do in the following page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Too-noisy-too-many-actions2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Too noisy, too many actions" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Too-noisy-too-many-actions2.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found 27, how about you? This does not even include the 3 drop down lists which will certainly give you more work.  And we are cheating a bit here. The space taken up by "Where did you go to school?" block could easily pile in another 10+ actions if it's a normal news block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third problem, the lack of discipline in using the whitespace.  &lt;/strong&gt;Whitespace is one of the most powerful, visually pleasing and least intrusive way to bring orders and visual hierarchies to a design. Yet what do you think of the whitespace in this &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23python"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best of&lt;/em&gt; #Python&lt;/a&gt; page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Best-of-python2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Best of #python" src="/images/2013-05-17-google-plus-is-skin-deep/Best-of-python2.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this?! The only thing that seems to be useful is this one single line: "Hy: Lisp subset that compiles to Python". The rest of the screen space? Wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a step back and think about what's the goal for Google+. It's fundamentally a river of short messages that might be interesting to the user.  I imagine most of the times people would just scroll through and see whether something catches their eyes. The new Google+ fails to deliver an experience that maximizes this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Even at a pure visual design level, Google+ is still not up to the standard. The vertical alignments, margin between elements within one block would use more refinement. The avatar is inconsistent. Sometime they're round.  Most of the times square. But arguing design for design's sake is missing the point here. It has to be functionally useful first. Without that, it's a castle on the sand.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Those decision making moments</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/those-decision-making-moments.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-05T22:51:37+12:00</published><updated>2013-05-05T22:51:37+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-05-05:/those-decision-making-moments.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W&lt;strong&gt;hat represents a good entrepreneur&lt;/strong&gt;?   Some would think a talented engineer furiously coding on a clever algorithm; or the CEO in his suit winning some award.  I think those are only a tiny fraction of startup life.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W&lt;strong&gt;hat represents a good entrepreneur&lt;/strong&gt;?   Some would think a talented engineer furiously coding on a clever algorithm; or the CEO in his suit winning some award.  I think those are only a tiny fraction of startup life. They are not as interesting as one might think.  If you are an experienced programmer and you know what needs to be done,  you just go ahead and code the solution out.  It's like a good walk in a park.  Enjoyable but nothing fancy.  Winning awards? It's an important milestone but not a good indication of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;strong&gt;it's the ability to make good decisions&lt;/strong&gt;.   By definition, a good entrepreneur is the one who makes most important decisions right.  A corollary is that for a startup with two founders, it's about make the right decisions together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two founders should come out of the debate with a better  idea, one that weren't there in their mind before the debate started.  &lt;/strong&gt;This would require the two founders to sit down,  carefully listen to what the other is saying,  comb through what works and what not, acknowledge the weakness of his own solution and, usually as a by-product of doing all the above, creatively come up a brand new idea that takes the best parts from both while avoiding the known problems. If you can do that, you've got a winning team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. When people say a &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"&gt;solo founder is really hard&lt;/a&gt;,  they probably mean solo founder doesn't have someone to bounce off ideas with.  Hence he may miss the opportunity to get to a better solution.  So in my opinion, if you are a solo founder, go find yourself a strong advisory board, have someone you trust and use them to tease out the best ideas that weren't in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>What's wrong with TechNZ's evaluation process</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/what-wrong-technz-evaluation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-07T22:09:29+12:00</published><updated>2013-04-07T22:09:29+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-04-07:/what-wrong-technz-evaluation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on the advisory board of the dental software company Software Surgery.  We have had such a frustrating experience applying for a &lt;a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/update-me/archive/frst-funding-archive/technz-terms-and-conditions/"&gt;TechNZ&lt;/a&gt; funding that I believe &lt;strong&gt;New Zealand needs a government grant/funding option designed specifically for software startups. &lt;/strong&gt; The current system is probably well designed for …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on the advisory board of the dental software company Software Surgery.  We have had such a frustrating experience applying for a &lt;a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/update-me/archive/frst-funding-archive/technz-terms-and-conditions/"&gt;TechNZ&lt;/a&gt; funding that I believe &lt;strong&gt;New Zealand needs a government grant/funding option designed specifically for software startups. &lt;/strong&gt; The current system is probably well designed for manufacturing products but they are just unsuitable for software projects who can use helps from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate a software startup's worth, I'd look at three things: idea, founders and the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: dentists are still referring patients to each other using paper based forms. Every year, there would be patients who "fall through the crack" and, as a consequence, their treatments were delayed. Bad things happened. The dentists get severe penalty. Yet dentists are among the most busiest people in all professions. They are constantly under time pressure and unhappy patients.  Stacy's software makes it really easy for dentists to track and follow through a case to make sure the referrals have been taken care of.  Clear problem. Well designed solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid team. &lt;a href="http://nz.linkedin.com/pub/stacy-hunt/38/aa0/251"&gt;Stacy&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO and founder of the company has sold his previous company in 2003; He is building the product using his own money from selling the previous one.  Before taught himself design and programming, Stacy spent more than 15 years as a dentist.  I haven't seen anyone who have so much in-depth knowledge in programming, design and dental industry.  Talking about domain knowledge and startup experience, I wouldn't expect anyone better than Stacy to take on a dental software.  Besides We also have &lt;a href="http://nz.linkedin.com/pub/john-hamilton/58/216/a85"&gt;John Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, who sits on the Dental Council of New Zealand as another advisor.  John has to write reports for different medical cases due to "referral  accidents". He has personally made sure that the software is usable and provide the tools and workflow dentists would use. And no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market: there are more than 2000 dentists in New Zealand. More in Australia, UK and around the world. Most dental clinics have computers but no one so far can track referrals, check updates, provide great tools to attach X-ray pictures. Mature market. Ready for the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, as we went through the TechNZ process, we have to answer questions that are just utterly unfit for software projects which moves really fast and the margin to replicate is near to zero.  My favorite one is a table to fill in a year-to-year "revenue project for 7 years".  &lt;strong&gt;7 freaking years!  &lt;/strong&gt;I believe the people working in government's Economic Development Unit have the best intention to make sure that tax money are not wasted.  But with the wrong framework and process, they &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; wasting time and money.  Even worse, they are not solving the problem but they have become part of the many obstacles that an entrepreneur needs to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is the email Stacy sent to withdraw his application, which gives an excellent view on the different between a software project and a typical 'industrial' project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to withdraw the grant application, because now that I've seen more of the process involved in the grant it's become apparent that our project isn't a good fit for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the environment that we operate in, key attributes are agility and responsiveness. Once users get their hands on our product, we'll need to be able to rapidly and probably quite dramatically adapt our plan and processes to what we discover. Very small details which can't be predicted can alter how we need to proceed. For example, it may be that users see value in some aspect of our solution that we hadn't anticipated and we need to change our sales model to give away for free what we had intended to charge for in order to leverage that value. I could give you a list of imagined cases with a risk assessment and mitigation plan for each, but it would be truly pointless; what I can tell you for sure is that whatever we try to predict, the reality will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that there's a need for diligence in administering grants - it's just a question of degree, or the level of detail that is useful. At one extreme is a guy who has a concept but no clue how to build it or market it; at the other is a guy who spends 10 years planning out every minute detail and never builds anything (I'm referring to "paralysis by analysis" here). Real startup projects sit at various places on that spectrum, and the art is knowing how much planning is helpful and how much is a hindrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm an investor in this project, and I wouldn't have spent a cent on it until I got a team together that I was confident would be able to adapt and solve problems across the full range - business strategy, sales, design, development and administration. The key difference is that I believe the greatest risk mitigation strategy in this environment is the team iteself; predicting the details of what the team is going to encounter may create the illusion of certainty at the outset but it quickly becomes irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue that I'm encountering is that the process is too slow for our project, and the time that I need to invest in creating the illusion of certainty is a risk to the project in itself. We've already started spending on it and because only expenses after the approval date are eligible, the value of the grant to the project has already changed significantly. In other words, the project needs to move rapidly and the grant process can't move rapidy - so again it doesn't seem like a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this makes some sense. It's a complex decision and I can't give you a rich understanding of where I'm coming from in a short Email unfortunately; but perhaps it will be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to you both for the effort and time that you've put in, and no doubt there will be news about how things are going from time to time. I'm not arrogant enough to assume that it's a sure-fire thing and my approach is the only one - but from what I've seen and experienced it's the approach that I want to bet on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/rodney-tamblyn"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; wrote me an email responding to my previous post of "&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/understanding-open-source/"&gt;understand open source&lt;/a&gt;".   His comments led me into some deeper thinking of the difference of open source and commercial software projects. And what they can learn from each other, which I will publish a post later. (Disclaimer: I'm an independent advisor to &lt;a href="http://ob3.cc/"&gt;OceanBrowser&lt;/a&gt;, Rodney's company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not my intention to draw a black-and-white line and assert "open source is all good and commercial software are just evil". Quite contrary to that, I'm strongly against monoculture. Either it's only open source or only commercial software.  Plus, these two terms not even exclusive to each other nowadays.  Android and Ubuntu are both large scale open source projects run by a commercial company, for commercial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before I go on and share Rodney's reply. Let's remind ourselves that I'm also against the idea of over-generalization. So please read the following with a large grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So if I am missing a needed feature in a project and I do nothing about it, it is my own fault for not getting off my lazy arse and taking advantage of the participation opensource allows."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characterizing a user as lazy because they don't want to get involved in this way isn't constructive.  The world is full of complicated things that don't work - there may be a mismatch of expectations, especially around suitability for purpose, quality, and reliability.  "taking advantage of the participation opensource allows" could be a euphism here for someone disappearing down a rabbit hole of forums, testing and so forth that completely diverts them from the user from what they were trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a proprietary product, if I like it, the only way I am allowed to participate in it’s improvement is by buying it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe this?  Most of the people who have contributed to helping in the development of OB3 haven't directly bought it - students, teachers etc.  It suggests that closed source developers are fixated on financial returns or money as an indicator of importance.  Which I would reject, at least in our case, the contrary position is it is about control and design, it can just represent a choice about how you want to build your vision.  Then there are all the projects out there where the product is closed source but big chunks of the underlying platform are open sourced.  Or ones which are open sourced with a close source commercial build for "enterprise".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time starved user who reads the hype about some open source product, pours hours and hours into learning about it (event pit) installing and configuring, only to find that it is unstable and bug ridden, they are supposed to now fix it - or shut up?  I'm not the type that slags OS projects by the way…. just putting the contrary view here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So my buying dollars dont directly go to the improvement of that product"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may depend on the type of product you are talking about, and how you define what is "improving the product" - is it just engineering?  If the product needs design, research, maybe you need a team working full time on that - and someone has to pay their salaries.Anyway,  better get back to work… above could do with more drafting.  This article reduces closed source/ commercial development to a caricature - not all closed source firms are evil money focused bottom line etc…&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Understanding Open source</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/understanding-open-source.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-16T21:25:13+13:00</published><updated>2013-02-16T21:25:13+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-02-16:/understanding-open-source.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- open source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started doing some research on how open source communities are governed. My goal is to use today's open source projects as a way to figure out how to run a community when the only force that put people together is love and interest.  I'll publish my notes and whatever interests me along the way here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent short piece on why open source's "success" is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what a "marketer" would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the opensource system, if you find any deficiency in the project, the onus is on you to redress that deficiency. Opensource projects provide you with the means and mechanism to not only remove inadequecies in any part of the project but also to improve the project. Without this positive feedback loop an opensource project dies. &lt;strong&gt;Opensource doesnt improve by advocacy, mindshare, or by having 10 million users, it improves by the participation and contribution from the user community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that boils down to is, if you see something wrong and do nothing about it, the opensource system hasnt failed you, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have failed the opensource system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I am missing a needed feature in a project and I do nothing about it, it is my own fault for not getting off my lazy arse and taking advantage of the participation opensource allows. One of the things that really annoys me is the continual slagging of some of the other opensource projects that get more media time. It is ok slagging a proprietary product as often you have no other way of getting your neck into the user-development feedback loop. But slagging an opensource project is ignorant. The whole mechanism exists to empower the user. If there is something that would cause that person to slag a project then it means enough to them to do something about it. In simpler words, fix it! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a rule marketers count bodies&lt;/strong&gt; lol. With a proprietary product, if I like it, the only way I am allowed to participate in it's improvement is by buying it. The more I buy, the more likely it is to be successful and provide me with something stable and persistent in the future to develop and deploy with. The more users that buy the proprietary product, add to that companies ability to improve that product. This includes not only the cost of the development but all the other stuff that goes along with it, like profit, marketing etc. So my buying dollars dont directly go to the improvement of that product, even so lots of users is good for a proprietary products future.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Better way to teach beginning programming classes</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/better-way-to-teach-beginning-programming-classes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-29T17:53:23+13:00</published><updated>2013-01-29T17:53:23+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-01-29:/better-way-to-teach-beginning-programming-classes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my friend sent me this &lt;a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/165.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, which kind of explains why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a template for a first programming class: Use a book with a language name in the title. Start with the very basics like formatted output and simple math. Track through more language features with each chapter and assignment, until at the end of the semester everyone is working with overladed operators and templates and writing their own iterators and knows all the keywords related to exception handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a student in a class like this, you have my sympathy, because it's a terrible way to be introduced to programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author went on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've learned a small subset of a language like Python--variables, functions, control flow, arrays, and dictionaries--then features are no longer the issue. Sure, you won't know all the software engineery stuff like exceptions and micromanagement of variable and function scopes, but it's more important to learn how to turn thoughts into code before there's any mention of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd even go so far as to say that &lt;a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/93.html"&gt;most OOP&lt;/a&gt; is irrelevant at this point, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My real template for a first programming class is this: Teach the bare minimum of language features required to do interesting things. Stop. Spend the rest of the semester working on short assignments that introduce students to problem solving and an appreciation for the usefulness of knowing how to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this was the exactly how &lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer"&gt;Little Schemer&lt;/a&gt; teaches programming.  That is, to treat learning programming as a training for problem solving skills instead of a way to memorize syntax.  I thought the problem has been solved when the book was published back in December, 1995 but apparently it has become almost too old to matter that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Ward Cunningham answered "Do wikis have to be ugly?

&lt;p&gt;I have been bothered with the question "does community site have to be ugly to succeed" for a long time.  You see, most of the successful long running community sites are 'ugly'.

On the other side, you have the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/30/users-revolt-against-new-digg/"&gt;digg redesign fiasco&lt;/a&gt;, although one can argue that whether the strong correlation here equals to cause-and-effect. But it is a fact that &lt;a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2012/03/my-webstock-talk.html"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of Metafilter, once redesigned the site to be more 'web 2.0' and noticed a significant traffic drop when he A/B tested the new design using live traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  Isn't this against the human nature of appreciating order and beauty? Does it mean that all of our knowledge in fonts, colors or layouts are useless?  Or maybe there are something unique about community sites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father of wiki, Ward Cunningham, gave a &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/52637141"&gt;talk about his new wiki idea&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago.  Something he said about the design of wiki finally answered that question for me. Here is what he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone came up to me and said "the idea of wiki is neat but do they have to be ugly? ".  My answer was "yeah, basically they do.  &lt;strong&gt;Because when you make it beautiful, then anybody that can not match your beauty has been closed out of the conversation.&lt;/strong&gt; So I say clean and simple. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my belief that each service/product needs to be optimised to serve its core need.  The fundamental role a community site performs is a platform to get "fresh and unique thoughts" from its members. Anything else is merely a tool to the end.   Counter intuitively, inhibiting the urge to make things visually appealing actually helps to achieve this goal.  Because the more attention people devote to tweak their look-and-feel of content, the less time they would spend to make it more intellectually interesting.  So accidentally, &lt;strong&gt;the 'ugliness' of the community site turned out to be a killer feature that helps to keep people focus on talking about their thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;, even though I bet most sites didn't start realizing that.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>There's More to Life Than Being Happy</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/theres-more-to-life-than-being-happy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-27T19:32:20+13:00</published><updated>2013-01-27T19:32:20+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-01-27:/theres-more-to-life-than-being-happy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1942, Viktor Frankl, a prominent Jewish psychiatrist and neurologist in Vienna, was arrested and transported to a Nazi concentration camp with his wife and parents. Three years later, when his camp was liberated, most of his family, including his pregnant wife, had perished -- but he, prisoner number 119104, had lived. In his bestselling 1946 book, Man's Search for Meaning, which he wrote in nine days about his experiences in the camps, Frankl concluded that the difference between those who had lived and those who had died came down to one thing: Meaning, an insight he came to early in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he saw in the camps, those who found meaning even in the most horrendous circumstances were far more resilient to suffering than those who did not. "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing," Frankl wrote in &lt;em&gt;Man's Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt;, "the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankl worked as a therapist in the camps, and in his book, he gives the example of two suicidal inmates he encountered there. Like many others in the camps, these two men were hopeless and thought that there was nothing more to expect from life, nothing to live for. "In both cases," Frankl writes, "it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them." For one man, it was his young child, who was then living in a foreign country. For the other, a scientist, it was a series of books that he needed to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people before me have lamented the way that we in industrialized countries regard our elderly as unproductive workers or obsolete products, and lock them away in institutions instead of taking them into our own homes out of devotion and duty. Most of these critiques are directed at the indifference and cruelty thus displayed to the elderly; what I wonder about is what it’s doing to the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segregating the old and the sick enables a fantasy, as baseless as the fantasy of capitalism’s endless expansion, of youth and health as eternal&lt;/strong&gt;, in which old age can seem to be an inexplicably bad lifestyle choice, like eating junk food or buying a minivan, that you can avoid if you’re well-educated or hip enough. So that when through absolutely no fault of your own your eyesight begins to blur and you can no longer eat whatever you want without consequence and the hangovers start lasting for days, you feel somehow ripped off, lied to. Aging feels grotesquely unfair. As if there ought to be someone to sue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t see old or infirm people much in movies or on TV. We love explosive gory death onscreen, but we’re not so enamored of the creeping, gray, incontinent kind. Aging and death are embarrassing medical conditions, like hemorrhoids or eczema, best kept out of sight. &lt;strong&gt;Survivors of serious illness or injuries have written that, once they were sick or disabled, they found themselves confined to a different world, a world of sick people, invisible to the rest of us.&lt;/strong&gt; Denis Johnson writes in his novel “Jesus’ Son”: “You and I don’t know about these diseases until we get them, in which case we also will be put out of sight.”&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>One fundamental difference between ElasticSearch and Solr</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/one-fundamental-difference-between-elasticsearch-and-solr.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-22T22:39:58+13:00</published><updated>2013-01-22T22:39:58+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-01-22:/one-fundamental-difference-between-elasticsearch-and-solr.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;important update&lt;/strong&gt;: The recent release of Solr 4 has addressed the difference mentioned below. Now Solr handles replication similarly to ElasticSearch. Even better, a transaction log has been added for durabilities. So please be aware that the information below is more a comparison between ElasticSearch and Solr 3.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the articles comparing ElasticSearch and Solr fall into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group would give some performance test and declare one outperforms the other. Like &lt;a href="http://blog.socialcast.com/realtime-search-solr-vs-elasticsearch/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from socialcast.  If you dig deeper though, you'll realize that it's not a fair comparison. The ElasticSearch's read will waste too much time in routing with the default 5 shards settings;  For Solr, you are not supposed to call IndexWriter#commit for every write request anyway. The author also ignored the fact that Solr 4's soft commit would make search while indexing a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group provides feature-by-feature comparison like the &lt;a href="http://blog.sematext.com/2012/08/23/solr-vs-elasticsearch-part-1-overview/"&gt;Sematext one&lt;/a&gt;.  This does provide a more comprehensive view on what's available in each package. Let's be honest, most of the features can be implemented given enough time.  I'm sure ElasticSearch will have a proper SpellChecker soon and it won't take too long for Solr to have a percolate feature implemented.  Unfortunately, this hides the fundamental architectural differences between the two, which is actually crucial for people to decide which one to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there is only one fundamental difference here but it does have far reaching consequences on how each would perform. &lt;strong&gt;The difference is how the distributed replication works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this, you have to look at Lucene's index on disk first. Lucene stores its search index in immutable segments and then &lt;strong&gt;as more documents are indexed, these immutable segments will be merged into new, and more efficient, ones.&lt;/strong&gt;  Inevitably, this will incur non-trivial disk read/write. It'll be slow.  Within Lucene, this usually happens when a commit call happens. (To keep things easier, let's ignore the difference between soft and hard commit in Solr 4 for now. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ElasticSearch and Solr use Lucene to store their search index but how the changes replicated to different servers differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solr&lt;/strong&gt; will &lt;strong&gt;copy the new segment file to different servers&lt;/strong&gt;. This works great when you don't need to add new documents to your search index too often.  But in the age of an endless stream of contents keep flowing in and the needs for near real time search, this decision is seriously holding us back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there is an &lt;strong&gt;inherent conflict on how often to call commit&lt;/strong&gt; here.  If you want your new content to show up in other search shards, you want to call commit as often as possible so that new segments can be created and copied over. However, if you want to index fast, you want to avoid, or at least delay, commit at all cost so that you can keep indexing stuff without cleaning up the disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ElasticSearch solved this problem by sending the same document to be indexed by all the search shards.&lt;/strong&gt;  To be more precise, all the replica shards. This way, you will never need to call commit to get your index shipped to other server. You can index as many as you like and still have all information available to all replica shards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important result of this approach is that ElasticSearch offers a much &lt;strong&gt;robust single server deployment by having a write ahead log&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you kill it brutally, you know the dash 9 thing, a single node ElasticSearch would still be able to recover, replay and keep going. Try that with Solr and you'll have to manually fix the corrupted index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important consequence  is that it's relatively easy to have a &lt;strong&gt;High Availability built-in.  &lt;/strong&gt;If the primary shard goes down, one of the replicas can take over and elect itself to be the primary without causing too much troubles because all replica shards have already had the same content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one minor downside to this approach though. If your application has a high rate of modification to the same document, then that change might arrive at the replica out of sequence. This can be addressed by using versioning but I really doubt a search engine will have such a high modification rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this clarifies things a bit. I also hope that now if you look at the feature-by-feature comparison, you would appreciate the differences better by understanding what's the rational behind them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Aaron Swartz and ragequitting</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/aaron-swartz-and-ragequitting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-22T20:33:58+13:00</published><updated>2013-01-22T20:33:58+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-01-22:/aaron-swartz-and-ragequitting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On competition and the excitement of doing something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired:&lt;/strong&gt; Google is known for encouraging its employees to tackle ambitious challenges and make big bets. Why is that so important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry Page:&lt;/strong&gt; I worry that something has gone seriously wrong with the way we run companies. If you read the media coverage of our company, or of the technology industry in general, it’s always about the competition. The stories are written as if they are covering a sporting event. &lt;strong&gt;But it’s hard to find actual examples of really amazing things that happened solely due to competition. How exciting is it to come to work if the best you can do is trounce some other company that does roughly the same thing?&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why most companies decay slowly over time. They tend to do approximately what they did before, with a few minor changes. It’s natural for people to want to work on things that they know aren’t going to fail. But incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time. Especially in technology, where you know there’s going to be non-incremental change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the importance of both innovation and commercialisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired:&lt;/strong&gt; On the other hand, as the canard goes, the pioneers take the most arrows. Look at the experience of Xerox PARC, where fantastic innovations didn’t seem to &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/16/110516fa_fact_gladwell"&gt;help the corporation itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page:&lt;/strong&gt; PARC had a tremendous research organization and they invented many of the tools of modern computing. But they weren’t focused on commercialization. You need both. &lt;strong&gt;Take one company I admire, Tesla. They’ve not only made a really innovative car, but they’re probably spending 99 percent of their effort figuring out how to actually get it out to people.&lt;/strong&gt; When I was growing up, I wanted to be an inventor. Then I realized that there’s a lot of sad stories about inventors like Nikola Tesla, amazing people who didn’t have much impact, because they never turned their inventions into businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Where the media stands?

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  Of all the news coverage on Aaron Swartz's case, &lt;strong&gt;Guardian&lt;/strong&gt; provided the best coverage; &lt;strong&gt;Economist&lt;/strong&gt; got and described the core accurately and timely;  &lt;strong&gt;NYTimes&lt;/strong&gt; got the key points, but failed to follow up; &lt;strong&gt;BBC&lt;/strong&gt; structured it as a "debate"; Japan's &lt;strong&gt;Yomiuri&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Asahi&lt;/strong&gt;, China's &lt;strong&gt;PeopleDaily&lt;/strong&gt; had no coverage of this; &lt;strong&gt;WSJ&lt;/strong&gt; is misleading its readers by associating the cause with depression; China's &lt;strong&gt;Xinhua&lt;/strong&gt; performed the worst by talking about "&lt;em&gt;prevalence of depression in the tech community"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Swartz's funeral has come and past.  It's time for us to move on. But before we dive into all the new year's works, it is very important for us to review what the major newspapers around the world have said about this and use it as a gauge to see where they position themselves on this case.  Or to put it more bluntly: did they get it? &lt;strong&gt;Did they get the core of this case is "free access to public document" instead of IP theft, national security or suicide after long depression? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important because this case won't be the last collision between technologists who try to push the world forward and the incumbents who don't understand technology's role and want to set a precedent to stop this inevitable trend.   As software and AI evolve further, more labour and manual jobs will be replaced by robots and algorithms. Whether we will have a relatively smooth transition or a turmoil largely depends on how the public opinions are shaped. So far, it doesn't look very good. As said by &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/01/aaron_swartz_suicide_prosecutors_have_too_much_power_to_charge_and_intimidate.html"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying point ... is that the government doesn’t understand hackers and isn’t good at distinguishing between miscreant vigilantes like Swartz who are trying to free information systems and profit-driven or diabolical hackers who are trying to bring down those systems. That’s when an expansive law like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act becomes dangerous. Prosecutors persuaded of their own righteousness, and woodenly equating downloading a deliberately unprotected database with stealing, lose all sense of proportion and bring in the heavy artillery when what’s in order is a far more mild penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guardian&lt;/strong&gt; offers the &lt;strong&gt;best writing&lt;/strong&gt; on this.  Article &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/ortiz-heymann-swartz-accountability-abuse"&gt;Carmen Ortiz and Stephen Heymann: accountability for prosecutorial abuse&lt;/a&gt; directly points the root of the problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the US government - as part of its war to vest control over the internet in itself and in corporate factions - has been wildly excessive, almost hysterical, in punishing even trivial and harmless activists who are perceived as "hackers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jan/15/aaron-swartz-husband-prosecutor-criticises"&gt;Aaron Swartz: husband of prosecutor criticises internet activist's family&lt;/a&gt;, author provides lots of in-depth interview with Aaron's lawyers and attorneys to shed lights into the gruelling negotiation process that Aaron has gone through; and the ugly, disgusting faces of the prosecutors.   Now compare this to WSJ's &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/AP2e1b837317d14dbab268f56bff084b10.html"&gt;brief coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Good, Swartz's initial lawyer, told the Boston Globe that he had warned one prosecutor, Steve Heymann, that his client was a "suicide risk".
Good said: "His reaction was a standard reaction in that office, not unique to Steve. He said: 'Fine, we'll lock him up.'  I'm not saying they made Aaron kill himself. Aaron might have done this anyway. I'm saying they were aware of the risk, and they were heedless."
Lawyers for Swartz said they had offered to accept a deferred prosecution or probation, so that if he did it again he would serve time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Weinberg, who took over from Good as Swartz's lawyer, confirmed to the Guardian that during negotiations for a plea bargain, MIT refused to take a position which could have helped his client.
Weinberg said: "During pleas negotiations for Mr Swartz, he attempted to negotiate an agreement that would not subject him to any risk of going to prison. We asked them to support this initiative but they declined. As a matter of fact, MIT as an institution communicated to myself that they would not take any position in ongoing pleas negotiations between Mr Swartz and the government."
"There were subsets of the MIT community who were profoundly in support of Aaron," but that support did not override institutional interests, Weinberg told the Globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Swartz's attorneys, Elliot Peters, said on Monday that MIT officials were "very cooperative with prosecutors" during the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economist, my favourite magazine, pointed out the essence of this case in its article &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/01/remembering-aaron-swartz?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/commons_man"&gt;Commons Man&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TO CALL Aaron Swartz gifted would be to miss the point. As far as the internet was concerned, he was the gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2006 he obtained—though he would not say how—the complete bibliographic data for books held by the Library of Congress. He thought it unfair that the Library's catalogue division charged hefty fees to provide this information, which, &lt;strong&gt;being the work of the government, had no copyright protection within the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; So he posted it in the Open Library, which aims to provide an entry for every book in existence as part of Internet Archive, a project founded by the internet entrepreneur Brewster Kahle to store a copy of every web page of every website ever to go online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aghast at how federal court documents were available only for a price from the inappositely named Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system, in 2009 he used the free access temporarily granted to public libraries to retrieve 18m pages of PACER's 500m documents before he was cut off. They ended up on public.resource.org, founded by Carl Malamud, a veteran advocate of open access, also known as the internet's public librarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Economists correctly pointed out Swartz's cause was open access to public documents, the &lt;strong&gt;NYTimes&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly writing about him as a purist all-information-must-be-free ideologue.  But to its credit, it did mention the cause of changing the &lt;em&gt;Computer Fraud and Abuse Act&lt;/em&gt; in article &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/technology/aaron-swartz-a-data-crusader-and-now-a-cause.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;pagewanted=print"&gt;A Data Crusader, a Defendant and Now, a Cause&lt;/a&gt; and provide a link to the &lt;a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/reform-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-reflect-realities-computing-and-networks-2013/qMvdwVNw"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; itself. The article &lt;a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/what-is-a-hacktivist/"&gt;What Is a ‘Hacktivist’?&lt;/a&gt; comes at the right time to paint a personal, friendly and make-the-world-better picture of hacktivist.  But somehow they stopped from following through the case. They didn't challenge Carmen Ortiz's husband's tweet either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, majority of the traditional newspapers either failed to appreciate the importance of this event or, even worse, try to distract attentions by associating this with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC&lt;/strong&gt; barely scratched the issue during this event.  It did mention this case in article &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21011663"&gt;Aaron Swartz investigation ordered by MIT&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to me that BBC has failed to grasp the essence of this event by finishing the article with this:&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in a blog post, Orin Kerr, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School, wrote the actions of the prosecutors had been "based on a fair reading of the law".
"None of the charges involved aggressive readings of the law or any apparent prosecutorial overreach," he said.
"All of the charges were based on established case law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan's two most popular newspaper &lt;strong&gt;Yomiuri&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Asahi&lt;/strong&gt; and China's government mouthpiece &lt;strong&gt;PeopleDaily&lt;/strong&gt; has no mentions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WSJ&lt;/strong&gt; is muddying the water by linking this to the suicide and depression angle even though more than &lt;a href="Even though more than 80% of its reader rate the charge was &amp;quot;overzealous&amp;quot;: http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/question-day-229/topics/do-you-think-governments-prosecution"&gt;80% of its readers vote the charge to be "overzealous"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its article &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324595704578242230974876860.html"&gt;Web Activist's Suicide Highlights Tech Law&lt;/a&gt; began with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental-health experts cautioned against trying to settle on an explicit cause when someone kills himself. "I'm sure he perceived that as a stressor," Gregory Eells, director of counseling and psychological services at Cornell University, said of the criminal charges. But, he said, "It's always a stretch to say that's the only cause." Mr. Eells wasn't familiar with details of the Swartz case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and ended with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On what would prove to be the morning of his death, Ms. Stinebrickner-Kauffman said, the couple had a tickle fight before she left for work. Mr. Swartz said he was going to stay home and rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its other article &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324581504578238692048200404.html"&gt;Legal Case Strained Troubled Web Activist&lt;/a&gt; went even further by talking about "state sponsored hackers who threaten national security" and "organized criminals who break into computers for financial gain".  WSJ, you were really trying hard to establish some link in your reader's mind, aren't you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What began as a straightforward report of a campus breaking-and-entering incident eventually ensnared Mr. Swartz, who had written publicly about his battle with depression, in the broader federal apparatus for prosecuting computer crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of their list of targets are state-sponsored hackers who threaten national security and organized criminals who break into computers for financial gain. The longest prison sentence so far in a U.S. hacking case—20 years–was given to a Miami man, Albert Gonzalez, in 2010 for his role in the theft and sale of millions of credit and debit cards.
In recent years, prosecutors in the U.S. and Europe have become increasingly concerned about the growth of hacking groups, known as "hacktivists."
The groups, sometimes formed under the guise of free-lance computer-security firms, have exposed the security vulnerabilities of computers used by government, law enforcement and corporations through online mischief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing comes as classic as China's &lt;strong&gt;XinHua's&lt;/strong&gt; blatant distraction tactic in its article &lt;a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-01/15/c_132103916.htm"&gt;Suicide of U.S. Internet activist fuels talk about depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominent U.S. Internet developer and activist Aaron Swartz committed suicide last week, which triggered heated discussion in Startupland these days about the prevalence of depression in the tech community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to finish this article by quoting &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/13/aaron-swartz-government-abuses-gilmor"&gt;Dan Gillmor's post&lt;/a&gt; on Guardian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember Aaron Swartz by working against government abuses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I lived in Massachusetts, where the U.S. Attorney with overall jurisdiction over Aaron's case may run for governor, I'd start working tomorrow to ensure that she couldn't get elected dogcatcher. I'd also raise money to pay the best and bravest lawyer I could find, to ask the Massachusetts Bar Association to investigate how she and the assistant U.S. attorney in direct charge of the case had acted, and whether they deserved to keep their licenses to practice law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where I lived, I would ask my member of the US House and my US senators how they can allow the computer crime laws they passed to criminalize a violation of a terms of service – an interpretation that could put any one of us in jail under the Justice Department's misuse of the law. If the people representing me didn't respond or expressed support for the administration's you're-all-potential-prisoners stance, I'd look for better representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wrote software code for, say, Facebook or any other big company, or was a young coder considering a startup, I'd ask myself whether my work was worthy of Aaron's memory – and if not, what I would do about that.
And I'd find and support organizations, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, that are carrying on the work Aaron championed, and did, to bring our culture and laws into the 21st Century in ways that value creativity, openness and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get angry. Then get busy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Soulmate lost. RIP Aaron Swartz.

&lt;li&gt;culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bestof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is true.  Aaron has killed himself.  That sucks.  I tried very hard not to cry but it hurts me deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had a chance to meet him in person but over the years, I get to "meet" him via his work.  I've always been surprised that such a prodigy actually exists among us. I've also had this weird feeling that he won't die of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron's code is a beautiful example of minimalism. Around 2006, I remember trying really hard to beat his abstraction of a python wrapper for db operations in &lt;a href="https://github.com/webpy/webpy/blob/master/web/db.py"&gt;web/db.py&lt;/a&gt;. I gave up after two weeks of attempts and reached a conclusion that he has achieved a perfect balance of just enough function. The whole thing is short, logic and beautiful. Like a poem. You can't take anything away from it.  He was 18 years old by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron's work is like that too.  Reddit was a good example of that where you can get raw thoughts and insightful discussions without worrying too much of format and etiquette. His less known work of Jottit is actually more impressive.  It's a failed attempt to build a minimal website where one can  publish raw ideas quick and easy. I had wanted to build a site like that but Aaron built exactly what I had in mind with a crispy clarity of purpose.  I named this blog "Raw thoughts from Alex Dong" after him as well.  A place to exchange ideas without all the fluffy, airy, wishy-washing bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend who used to work in a suicide help centre told me that, to many people, suicide is a way of revenge. It's one's last attempt to bet everything on this final attack.  I guess what Aaron is attacking is not only the legal case itself. But the cruel reality of this world.  Where an idealistic will eventually bump into layers and layers of lies; the ignorance of the general public; cold face from people who have already taken the pill and given up.  The more prodigious you are, the harder you get hit on the head.  Everyone has been saying how great you are and what a promising career you have in front of you. Then bump! Out of blue, you realise you are alone. Fighting hopeless without seeing the light.   Aaron has been so young yet so successful that when the harsh of the reality raised its ugly head right in front of him, he chose to keep attacking and attacking. Wish that he could win. He bet his most precious asset, his life, on this final attack.   But he has lost. He failed to find out the right tactic.  I worry that his death is futile. I worry that the world will soon move on with all the weekend entertainment, I worry that his cause will be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We programmers, with our new found power, are more likely to be idealistic about things. If something doesn't make sense, sure it should and can be fixed. The only problem is how long the code-debug cycle runs.  We believe that if only we can express our thoughts clearer, we could make a case and win. Then we would be busy moving to the next thing.   Yet the world moves painfully slowly. Most status quo disappears when they die of age.  This is a reality that's just not compatible with programmer's view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have wished that Aaron would be like Steve Jobs.  Learn the ways to make compromises. Put his head down and work on something that's hard. Then eventually change the world for the better.  Move humanity one step forward.   Before Steve Jobs, not many people in valley gives a shit about design, aesthetics. It's about tech, someone has told me.  After Steve Jobs, everyone suddenly starts to talk about "beautiful".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Aaron's death is a reminder to the rest of us idealistic programmers.  It told us loud and clear that we have to pick a battle that worth fighting for and be prepared for the hard, long, lonely journey. And hopefully come out from the other end knowing that we've tried our best and we have not wasted our talent and live.  We can finally rest in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye, Aaron.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Know your learning style</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/know-your-learning-style.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-05T19:23:07+13:00</published><updated>2013-01-05T19:23:07+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-01-05:/know-your-learning-style.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn't a top student in schools. My parents got called into school to "figure out a solution" a lot often than others.  I excel in some classes like history, chemistry and math but not others like literature.  I was appalling bad at remembering all those beautiful Chinese poems no matter how many times I tried to remember them.  I have never really understood why until I took the "&lt;a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html"&gt;learning style&lt;/a&gt;" test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the test, you will get to answer 40 a/b questions and in the end, you'll be presented with a report like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If your score on a scale is 1-3, you are fairly well balanced on the two dimensions of that scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your score on a scale is 5-7, you have a moderate preference for one dimension of the scale and will learn more easily in a teaching environment which favors that dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your score on a scale is 9-11, you have a very strong preference for one dimension of the scale. You may have real difficulty learning in an environment which does not support that preference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few interesting things I learned about myself.  &lt;em&gt;It's very scary to realise about this at age 35.&lt;/em&gt;  If I have known this test early in my life, I am sure I would make a lot of choices quite differently. (Explanation can be found &lt;a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit extreme on VISual vs VeRBal factor. This is exactly why I am so slow processing words, debating and remembering but I can clearly remember all the details of a street corner I drove past in a foreign city 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a strong GLObal instead of SEQuence learner, which means I will not carefully follow through a sequence of steps and my thoughts jump around quite a bit.  This explains one long question in my mind.  No matter how hard I try, it's almost impossible for me to get a high score in exams. I often forget to read the questions fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to play with something to understand it, that makes me a ACTive instead of a REFlective learner.  I guess this is the reason why I prefer computer programming instead of mechanical engineering because fundamentally I need to play to understand whereas most mechanical stuffs are done in CAD software and simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also a INTuitive instead of SENsing learner where I hate to repeat and love to play with new things.  So trying to force myself to become a diligence worker who consistently delivers just works against my nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the future of education, I believe all kids will be "profiled" so that a personalised course set will be delivered that tailored to the student's learning style.&lt;/strong&gt;  I can smell some opportunities around the corner here.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Fart apps and toilet check-in services</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/fart-apps-toilet-checkin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-05T12:43:06+13:00</published><updated>2013-01-05T12:43:06+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2013-01-05:/fart-apps-toilet-checkin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker News has long become too watery for my liking but I do routinely check out the "&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"&gt;bestcomment&lt;/a&gt;" page, which always surprises me with delight and insightful comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like this &lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4989923"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; on trivial applications and the stagnation of real progress in tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in charge have no vision. Everyone makes this complaint, because it's almost always true. The difference is that it's starting to matter. You can't "do technology" without vision. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're running a toothpaste factory, you don't need vision. You just need competent execution. You need people to show up and follow the plan without complaint. This kind of work can actually be managed. If you can cut costs without compromising on quality, you do it. It's not about vision. That's already solved. Vision was relevant long ago when someone figured out how to make toothpaste. Your job is just to keep abreast of competitors and seek rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VC-istan is a postmodern startup factory.&lt;/strong&gt; It's technically not a company, but as a tight social network, it functions as one. VCs, rather than properly competing, talk to each other and agree on who they like and who they don't. VC-istan's "serial entrepreneurs" are just glorified PMs whose egos make them unemployable. &lt;strong&gt;The real bosses are the VCs.&lt;/strong&gt; They want quick exits, as they should, because that's how the incentive systems that govern them are set up. &lt;strong&gt;The "tech press" are a sort of HR organization. Entrepreneurs are PMs, often mediocre ones, and engineers are chumps paid in lottery tickets.&lt;/strong&gt; This is just a big company that has managed to dress itself up as a thousand small ones that happen to be all controlled by the same people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have an ecosystem of commodity entrepreneurs hiring commodity engineers to implement commodity ideas. Ok, nothing to see here. Mobiles skwrking, mobiles chirping, take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that this isn't producing innovation? It shouldn't be. Yet VC-istan is doing a lot better than most large companies do. It seems inevitable in large organizations (including economies) that the resources gravitate toward players who don't have much in the way of vision. Innovation is the &lt;em&gt;exception&lt;/em&gt;. It adds variance. Given that we're social animals who judge one another based on reliability (low variance/minimal performance) rather than capability (expected return) it is socially &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people have the talent and the resources? I'm sitting on +4 sigma talent but have no money. The people with boatloads of money seem (with a few exceptions) to be lacking in vision (which means I can't tell if they have talent, but I have doubts). I can't say that I blame them. Why take risks if you have no need to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have now is a generation that's used to technical progress and wants to take part. We have people who have been working their asses off since age 4, are now in their 20s and 30s, and want to take part in technical innovation. Most of them can't, because there's so little of it actually going on, and because most work activity is bullshit oriented toward keeping one warlord boss's status high at the expense of another's, rather than being invested in true progress. That's depressing. It creates a malaise. A deep sense of ennui. Yawn, another fart app. We now have an unprecedented number of ridiculously talented, over-educated people saying, "Dude, where's my machine learning job?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that 2013 will see the beginning of a Flight to Substance, and if I'm right, that will put that talent to better use than fart apps and toilet check-in services. I don't know how it will play out. I have no clue who will fund it.&lt;/strong&gt; One sign of this is the increasing clamor for Valve-style open allocation. By the mid-2010s, you won't be considered a real tech company if you're running closed allocation (take heed, Google). If I'm right, that will help. That will help our generation work its way toward excellence. At least, some of us will go in that direction. Others will go off into the weeds of fart apps. May the market reward both crowds justly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how we fix tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open allocation. As long as the work is relevant to the company's needs, let people work on whatever they want. This enables &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; growth of technical talent. You don't have to poach qualified people with ridiculous signing bonuses. They quickly find a project that fits their skills and interests, and they actually improve while they work for you. Imagine that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop fetishizing either extreme of company size. Not all large companies are bad, not all startups are good. Nor vice versa. If your 50-person startup is running closed allocation with typical HR policies, then it's just a big company that failed to get big and it should be considered a massive joke. I've heard of people getting turned down for transfers in 20-person companies because of "headcount" limitations. If you want to work at a startup, then drop that shit and work for a real fucking startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand work on hard problems. Don't build someone's fart app for 5% equity. If you're in the press, don't reward stupidity either. Instead of cheering on idiots who get acquired for outrageous sums, ridicule them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 is coming fast. In a few hours, it'll be 1st January, 2013.   A lot have happened in 2012.  It's time to write them down and move on to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 is a watershed year for me.  Before 2012, I was a young man afraid of nothing; I had endless energy and would not even blink on taking on any Goliath standing between myself and the goal; I was a driven and self centred person, I didn't really understand emotion or human relationships.  I considered it a concept opposite to been objective and get things done. I thought it's a waste of time; I genuinely believed that given enough time and focus, I could jump right into any field and did something truly innovative and impressive in a short period of time;  I believed that the world operates on certain rules, only if I could figure them out;  I didn't worry about money. I thought my time and energy were too precious to waste on trivial stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 has turned me from a young idealistic young man into a pragmatic adult.  I become more self aware, begin to value human relationship.  My interests have finally shifted from pure technical challenges to solving real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work experience in 2012 came in two parts.  The first from January to late June.  I am very happy to see clear validation on my technical ability and product design skills.  I am also happily surprised by how good I am on strategic thinking.  I have definitely learned a few things about myself.  I don't have enough patience to work on the tactical tasks; I am ignorant of team rhythm and changed my mind without communicating properly, this has caused me and the people who work for me quite a bit trouble;  I'm not a good listener yet. I have largely ignored developing the soft skills;  I would work really long hours for a while and then either burn myself out or lost interests and have to stop and recharge. I don't operate like a typical engineer. I am more like an artist;  Last but not least, I lack the skill to build up and defend an argument, I am slow and deep thinker. Face-to-face debate is not to my advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part, from July to end of November has been challenging and full of drama. It's a painful experience where I act as an individual contributor.  There are some scenes that keep sneaking into my dreams even after a couple of months since I left the job. I was so stressed out that I became really sick twice in four months. I have always been a star employee throughout my career. So I haven't got much chance to observe the team dynamics from ground level.   It's quite rewarding to see how different personalities played out in a highly competitive environment.  I get to understand the leader's most important job is to build a team that can operate on its own, set a clear goal and trust people to deliver it; I start to appreciate the importance of having a goal and stick to it at least for a while even when new information shows up and that goal &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; not be 100% correct anymore. Team rhythm and morale is too important to be destroyed in a constant change of directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to see things from a lot more pragmatic viewpoints.  Everyone makes mistakes. Miscommunication exists. Team moves fast and information asymmetries is inevitable. This world is indeed many shades of grey. So instead of trying to work towards an ideal mental model, it's far easier and superior to stay open and keep adjusting the model with new findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with ex-paypal, ex-youtube, ex-hotmail folks and glean the insights help me to realise that no one can really change the world. We are all surfers manoeuvring for a better position and waiting for the perfect wave to come.  The world is ready to change and there happens to be someone at the right place and right time to make it happen.  There might be 10x or 100x difference in company valuation but at individual level, there really isn't that much difference;  I start to understand the importance of staying in one industry and gradually build up the relationship and the understanding instead of jumping around;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordered by priority, here are three things I'd like to focus on in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to have a baby.  Z and I are at the age where the calling is getting really loud. Time for us to send our own messages to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, to establish a stable financial foundation. All my previous experiences, either working as an employee or build a business and sell it are all one-shot deal. Once it's done, it's over. I have to keep working on the treadmill and peddling hard.  There are tons of things I would like to do but without a sound financial base, it's always hard for me to do the sales job,  convincing people and constantly managing expectations. I want to have enough money such that I could do things my own way and still be able to leverage capitals out there.  I'd spend time and energy on things that will generate cumulative revenue in the long run, even at the cost of short term financial gains. I would pick one sure-fire product and work on it hard.  On the same time, I want to diversify my energy onto a few other projects to keep myself from burning out and hopefully build a portfolio that can cancel out the inevitable up-and-downs that are out of my own control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, to spend significant time improving myself.  To quote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: &lt;em&gt;You want to know how to paint a perfect painting?  It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.&lt;/em&gt;  I'll spend some time on iOS and Object-C in 2013 but I would like to invest the majority of my learning time on soft skills like: to improve my writing skill, both in English and Chinese; to get a lot better at critical thinking, assess information and develop reasoned arguments; to hone my listening skill and be able to communicate my thoughts in a clear and succinct manner. I have long term interests in education and life science and health. I am sitting on the board of two companies in these fields.  I want to to spend more time understanding these two industries and hopefully position myself in the game for a long term success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013, we'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Book Review: In Gold We Trust'</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/book-review-in-gold-we-trust.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-16T21:22:39+13:00</published><updated>2012-12-16T21:22:39+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-12-16:/book-review-in-gold-we-trust.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be bluntly honest, my knowledge in economic and financial policy is quite shallow.  I have yet understood how everything is hooked up together and how pulling one string here might trigger some consequences in other places.  I don't have the illusion that I could one day be able to predict what's going to happen. All I want for now is to understand the basic questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why modern countries no longer uses the golden standard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is money anyway? Is it a repository or a vehicle to hold value or a pure tool that governments uses to achieve some economic results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many appalling "crimes" Wall Street scientists committed using fiat money, what alternatives out there that offer a more solid ground for an international currency, if it's not USD anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the core question, shall I suggest my relatives to buy gold instead of USD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short book offers some sound answers. I'm sure only time will know which parts are true and which need further adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book comes with roughly 3 parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is to lay out the reality on where we are in terms of currency and the naive claim that goes back to gold-standard will fix all problems. I personally found this part to be least interesting. I think any avid reader of the Economists magazine will find the contents here rather familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is on the credibility of governments that confidence in money has fully depended since 1971, when President Richard Nixon finally broke the link between gold and the dollar. Gold's rise has been the consequence of this crisis of confidence in the paper promises of governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the advocates of this precious metal distract attention from the debate we need about how to restore the soundness of fiat money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part provides the history of gold, which I enjoyed tremendously.  So it turns out that Silver is probably more widely used as a currency instead of Gold. Also, the gold-standard adopted by Britain was a side-effect from Sir Issac Newton's calculation error.  It also lays out the process where wars forced western countries to keep deviating from gold standard and trade-inbalance ends up severing the link between dollar and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the evolutionary biology point of view, the separation of currency and gold is a natural step in the long and ongoing evolution process for money.  Money is taking up a dual role as both the container for value as well as a tool for modern governments to affect economic activities. The conflicts between these two roles is where most of the debates come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is not something absolute. It is a technology that has changed over millennia to meet our evolving need for a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value. That technology has had to adapt to changes in the real world. The rise of democracy drove the abandonment of the gold standard as a monetary system that, though it protected the value of money, was too rigid for modern welfare states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cash strapped governments through the centuries the answer was obvious: find ways to create more money. The first ruler on record to do this, in or around 400 BC, was Dionysius of Syracuse, who was stuck in a long and expensive war with the powerful trading empire of Carthage in North Africa. His coffers bare, he called in all the 1 drachma coins in circulation, on pain of death, and restamped them as 2 drachma, thereby magically doubling the amount of money in the economy. Such 'debasement' of money — nowadays (allegedly) through quantitative easing rather than restamping coins — is not only of doubtful morality, since governments are in effect robbing from their subjects or citizens, but also tends to have bad consequences. It was a fear of the economic and social upheaval that might be caused by money losing its value that drove Britain to adopt "sound money"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick glimpse into the difference between John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek is fascinating as well. This is the first time that I finally understand where Keynes come from and get to appreciate his perspective. I'd certainly try to read more about these two person and their books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynes, a gregarious and mercurial British intellectual, dazzled his peers with his brilliance and offered hope that even the seemingly most intractable economic problems could be solved by reasoning and, in certain circumstances, government action. Hayek, born in Vienna, was more pessimistic, warning of the excesses of big government and the inherent difficulty of top down economic policymaking. As he wrote in his last book, The Fatal Conceit, the "curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynes looked at money in a different way to his predecessors in economic thinking. Rather than judging money simply in terms of how well it measures and stores value, Keynes took a broader, utilitarian view, asking how money influenced the behaviour of the economy as a whole. Money, he believed, should be judged not on whether it was sound or not but on whether it served the needs of the economy. If sound money was causing unemployment, as it was in the 1920s and 1930s, do not blame the unemployed, blame money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the implications of this reimagining of money was that, rather than celebrating its role as a store of value over time, Keynes focused on how demand for it varied with the public's appetite for risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of government-supplied fiat money, he (Hayek) argued, there should be privately-created money. Guided by self-interest rather than politics, this would be free from the distortions of government money. Money, he believed, should be as freely traded as any other product or service. Thanks to the wisdom of the invisible hand of the market, which always exceeds the skill of the bureaucrat, money would become smarter, more efficient and more reliable. Governments might still choose to issue currencies, but these would only remain in circulation, he predicted, if citizens found them to be reliable stores of value. Market discipline would drive out unreliable money and promote sound money. (This looks a bit like how America ran its money before the Legal Tender Act of 1862 made the dollar a government monopoly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third part is, in my own words, cases for buying gold.  The book lists 3 potential scenarios where most of them would be a good case, but not an absolute one, for diversifying investments by buying in gold, which I found a quite natural and not very surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case for gold is, we believe, very different from the one offered by gold fundamentalists. The current resurgence of gold may be understood best not as a return to "true money", nor, indeed, the beginning of the revival of a barbarous relic, but as part of the latest phase of innovation in the technology of money. It will not be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the government deficit swells, and the political costs involved in cutting it by either spending less or taxing more grow ever larger, the temptation for politicians to reach for the inflation button may prove irresistible. The details of exactly how it would be done would no doubt remain murky: a technical rule change here by the Fed or the Treasury, a dismissal of a high inflation number as a one off there. Just as it has asserted its commitment to a strong dollar while pursuing policies that seem designed to weaken it, the US government would no doubt proclaim that it is determined to win the 'War on Higher Prices' even as it opens the monetary spigot ever wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of gold needs to be taken seriously by us all, because of what it tells us about the economic challenges now facing our world and the effectiveness (or lack of it) of our efforts to tackle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a matter of faith. Bits of paper and computer bytes change hands billions of times a day as a measure of value because we trust the promise that they represent. In today's era of fiat money, those promises rest ultimately on a guarantee by governments that they are valuable.
If you are looking for signals to buy gold as a hedge against a government-driven policy of inflation, one would be a lack of serious debate about deficit reduction during the 2012 presidential election campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also covers a little bit on alternative currencies and bitcoin but I found its effort rather shallow and lack of anything that's truly new or inspirational.  It also talks about a syndicate of multiple currencies into an international currency, an idea from Hayek, but it faces so many challenges that I wouldn't even think it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Book Review: Let my people go surfing'</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/book-review-let-my-people-go-surfing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-12T19:54:50+13:00</published><updated>2012-12-12T19:54:50+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-12-12:/book-review-let-my-people-go-surfing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a role model.  Mine is Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor clothing company Patagonia.   He is the type of entrepreneur who insists that he wants to&lt;strong&gt; do things on my own terms&lt;/strong&gt;.  As a successful business man, he starts the book by saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a businessman for almost fifty years. It's as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or a lawyer.  I've never respected the profession. It's business that has to take the majority of the blame for being the enemy of nature, for destroying native cultures, for taking from the poor and giving to the rich, and for poisoning the earth with the effluent from its factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet business can produce food, cure disease, control population, employ people, and generally enrich our lives. And it can do these good things and make a profit without losing its soul. That's what this book is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; that attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts by going through the history of Patagonia, its early "by climber, for climber" root. It's great detail to product's quality. It's "simplify" philosophy. Then it goes on to explain the crisis of Patagonia, the credit crisis and the soul searching part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it dives into the 8 philosophies of Patagonia. As a software entrepreneur, I found his "Product Design", "Production", "Image", "Human Resource" and "Management" are of particular interest to me. ( Yes, the environmental philosophy is so well known that, as a nature lover, I consider it to be common sense. Although I believe it's not a case for most people. ) As usual, here are some great quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make the best product" is the raison d'etre of Patagonia and the cornerstone of our business philosophy.  Striving to make the best quality product is the reason we got into business in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplify, simplify. - H.D. Thoreau
One "simplify" would have sufficed. - Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight quality first, against on-time delivery and low cost. A more sales-driven company might sacrifice a degree of quality to achieve on-time delivery, and a mass marketer might sacrifice both quality and on-time delivery to maintain the lowest cost.  Patagonia puts quality first, period.
Of course, if you do choose quality &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; on-time delivery or &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; paying a reasonable price, don't pat yourself on the back.  You've already blown it. You have to strive constantly to achieve all three, but quality is "more equal".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation.  He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both. - Francois Auguste Rene Chateaubriand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't hire the kind of people you can order around, like the foot soldiers in an army who charge from their foxholes without question when their sergeant yells, "Let's go, boys!" We want the kind of employee who will question the wisdom of something he regards as a bad  decision. We do want people who, once they buy into a decision and believe in what they are doing, will work like demons to produce something of the highest possible quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Book Review: Race against the machine'</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/book-review-race-against-the-machine.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-12T19:20:15+13:00</published><updated>2012-12-12T19:20:15+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-12-12:/book-review-race-against-the-machine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are certainly living in an interesting time.  Besides all the financial crisis looming on the horizon, there are some fundamental challenges facing all the countries, that is &lt;strong&gt;unemployment because of technology advancement&lt;/strong&gt;. In Spain, 60% people under 35 are unemployed. Despite all the seemingly good new, US is still losing job positions. But this time, it's not because of outsourcing to China or India, but because more and more jobs have been replaced by robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="201"]&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cover-201x300.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Race Against The Machine $3.99[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is written by two professors from &lt;a href="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/authors/"&gt;MIT Centre for Digital Business&lt;/a&gt;. This thin book really discussed two things: most jobs today will be replaced by robots and how we can cope with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, many of the mid-range jobs done by human being will be replaced by robots. This is the same thing that has happened to the horses in 19th century and bank tellers before ATM was introduced.  This has become very obvious when the recent economic recovery in US has seen strong growth yet no job has been created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grim unemployment statistics puzzled many because other measures of business health rebounded pretty quickly after the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009. GDP growth averaged 2.6% in the seven quarters after the recession’s end, a rate 75% as high as the long-term average over 1948-2007. U.S. corporate profits reached new records. And by 2010, investment in equipment and software returned to 95% of its historical peak, the fastest recovery of equipment investment in a generation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most economists aren't taking these worries very seriously. The idea that computers might significantly disrupt human labor markets—and, thus, further weaken the global economy—so far remains on the fringes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College graduates who seek the traditional type of job, where someone else tells them what to do each day, will find themselves increasingly in competition with machines, which excel at following detailed instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root of our problems is not that we’re in a Great Recession, or a Great Stagnation, but rather that we are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the stagnation of median incomes primarily reflects a fundamental change in how the economy apportions income and wealth. The median worker is losing the race against the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the authors suggest that the only way we human being can win this battle "against" the machine is to work side-by-side with the machine. As a society,  it's time for another good shake to some fundamental things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best chess player is a team of humans using computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, the computer, like all general purpose technologies, requires parallel innovation in business models, organizational processes structures, institutions, and skills. These intangible assets, comprising both organizational and human capital, are often ignored on companies’ balance sheets and in the official GDP statistics, but they are no less essential than hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most productive firms reinvented and reorganized decision rights, incentives systems, information flows, hiring systems, and other aspects of organizational capital to get the most from the technology. This, in turn, required radically different and, generally, higher skill levels in the workforce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also enables unbundling of instruction, evaluation, and certification, which encourages educational systems to be based more on delivering genuine, measurable results and less on simply signaling selection, effort, and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining videoconferencing, software, and networks with local teachers and tutors has a number of potential advantages. The very best “superstar” teachers can be “replicated” via technology, giving more students a chance to learn from them.In particular, softer skills like leadership, team building, and creativity will be increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily he has an answer and it’s a good one: &lt;strong&gt;“Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then is Principle Two for the successful optimist. All successful optimists have a project that is bigger than they are. By contrast, people who have a project that is the same size as themselves are invariably miserable and tedious company. Once you’ve got a bigger car/ nicer house/ television bigger than God what’s left? As so many find out, eventually the answer is a nagging emptiness accompanied by the thought, “Surely there must be more to life than this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with something bigger than themselves generally derive a deep-in-the-core happiness from whatever that is.&lt;strong&gt; It’s a happiness that comes from a feeling you have a place in the world.&lt;/strong&gt; A ‘bigger than me’ project can be your family, your religion, military service or a scientific calling. You don’t have to agree with another person’s ‘bigger than me’ project but it is true that people who have them are usually more driven, positive and able to get things done as a result. This is a happiness different from the passing pleasures of a good night out or great joke, and it will not manifest itself as merriment, but its motivating power is fundamental to the successful optimist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity in any form is healthy, as study after study has shown. Designing magazines and drawing on every surface imaginable has helped define who I am and my understanding of the world—and allows me to inform that world, shape it, and make it something imaginative and delightful. Finding a secondary creative outlet would allow my creativity, not my craft, to define me. In the meantime, it's nice to know I can drag a crayon across the page and feel like it’s all going to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at Avos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm feeling very grateful about this experience. I have learned so much in the past 14 months that I can't believe it's only a little more than 1 year.  This is my first "job" working out of mainland China, in a pure western culture. Also my first job working in the consumer internet space.   I'm sure that as the time goes by, the memory will become fuzzier.  So while the scenes are still fresh, I'd like to list what I have learned from all the outstanding people in Avos.  As my own way to say thank you and wave good bye to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh:  Remain calm and cool when some unexpected problem happens. Josh showed me what a truly talented engineer would be.  It's less about how much you know but how you can get the problem solved using the tools on hand.  I have always considered myself a good engineer but Josh made me realise that I'm too emotional to keep my brain always cool and logic.  Josh makes me feel I'm more an artist than an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan: Been professional means high performance no matter how you are treated.  I cherish the night when Alan, Israel and me walked back from office to hotel when we were in San Francisco. I've been consistently stunned by how hard and consistent Alan works no matter how much mis-understanding there have been.  He never seems to care whose fault it is. He just gets there and tries to get things sorted.  He also taught me again and again that "form follows function".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerwin: A team needs colour. Also what a young talent can learn and do in such a short period of time.  I love to tease Gerwin at work. I actually like to hear him cursing. It reminds me of my college years where I cursed like a sailor.  I think Gerwin brings colour and a bit spicy to an otherwise boring and too serious engineering team. Making us a better team really.   Besides that, his young age and how much he knows about javascript/css is clearly telling me that the web-native generation has grown up. Gerwin, you always makes me feel old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben:  Reliable, quiet and he-speaks-and-people-listen. I totally under-estimated Ben at the beginning.  You see, we value what we know.  Ben is this quiet, shy guy who seldom speaks. But as we collaborate side-by-side for the last a few months, I get to appreciate how he works. He is almost totally opposite from who I am. Hence making him a perfect work to work with.  Every morning, if I open up the mail and notice the bug reports, I would close it right away. I get bored checking system status dashboard everyday.  Yet Ben would happily pour his morning coffee and quietly squashed all the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BH:  Myself 12 years ago. I like BH because I always looked at him and thought to myself: wow, I did the exact same thing 12 years ago.  We always value talents, passion and energy. We under-value consistency, professional and maturity. But as I work with BH through the up and down, sitting in downtown San Francisco's hotel and listen to his rants, I found myself just loving him for all the youth idealism and energy. So pure and untainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel: The importance of knowing one's strength/weakness well. Israel have had a rough trip. He was assigned to the roles that were needed but didn't suit him.  Israel also keeps on reminding me how much a job means to a family.  For every job position, there is actually a whole family's happiness associated with it. There is his beautiful wife waiting at home. There are his two young boys asking where Dad is. I will not handle job positions lightly just because of this. People are not switchable widgets. They have emotions and families.  They deserve to be treated with respect and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve: How leader works. I do not agree with Steve on all things but I'd say most of the times, I am quietly impressed by how laser focused he is on the product.  I learned the value of being firm about an idea and push through to get a vision implemented instead of trying to convince everyone.  I am also on the receiver end to know how productive and happy I was when I had the trust and freedom to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim: Every engineering team needs a Tim. I've been working with Tim back in the old trunk.ly days but the past 14 months has shown the immense value of having a "tim" on the team.  To tight the loose ends and keep the whole team rowing towards the same direction.  I learn again and again from Tim the value of perform consistently no matter one gets the attention or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also others I have had the luck to work with that's not mentioned here, especially Andy, Lucy, Cheng, Vijay, Walter, Brent, Doug, Matt, George and Sara. I've also learned heaps from you folks.  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Four key skills for designing online communities</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/four-key-skills-for-designing-online-communities.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-24T13:45:13+13:00</published><updated>2012-11-24T13:45:13+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-11-24:/four-key-skills-for-designing-online-communities.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A carpenter and his apprentices were travelling through the province of Qi in search of building materials.
They saw a giant tree; five men all holding hands could not encompass its girth, and its crown reached almost to the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Let’s not waste our time with this tree,’ said the master carpenter. ‘It would take us for ever to cut it down. If we wanted to make a ship out of that heavy trunk, the ship would sink. If we tried to use it to build a roof, the walls would have to be specially reinforced.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group continued on its way. One of the apprentices remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Such a big tree and no use to anyone!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘That’s where you’re wrong,’ said the master carpenter. ‘The tree was true to its own destiny.
“If it had been like all the others, we would have cut it down. But because it had the courage to be different, it will remain alive and strong for a long time yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Gam Zou Letova</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/gam-zou-letova.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-08T11:34:19+13:00</published><updated>2012-11-08T11:34:19+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-11-08:/gam-zou-letova.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I learn about Israel and its culture, the more I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concrete example is this kind of &lt;a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ilan-abehassera"&gt;optimism&lt;/a&gt; after a total unfair treatment from a company whose motto is "Don't be Evil".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the interesting part. On my last day at Zlio, I had a long discussion with Jeremie, and despite the bad times, Jeremie was still very optimistic and even relieved I would say. Why? He told me his life’s theory, and it’s based on a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt; principle that I’ve been following ever since, and that has changed my life (yes really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hebrew we say “&lt;a href="http://www.neveh.org/price/price2.html"&gt;Gam Zou Letova&lt;/a&gt;”, that could be translated by : “Everything that happens in your life is for your own good”, or, “Every challenge makes you stronger”. You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jeremie explained it to me, I had a hard time understanding this optimistic principle in such hard times in his professional life. All he said was, don’t worry, good things will happen after this tough experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story about the screw-over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the little story, Zlio, became blacklisted/sandboxed by Google 6 months after…. It killed the company…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting something out the door was key also because it clarified our vision and focus more. We were making fewer guesses—not because of explicit user feedback and data analysis as much as just observing and experiencing real-world usage.

&lt;p&gt;People who grow up in the Holey Plane tend to relate to their environments differently than their traditional urban predecessors. ... With a car, an iPhone, and a credit card, one can be right at home throughout much of a metropolis like Houston. ... The explosion of social media and smartphone apps epitomizes this shift, transforming countless aspects of city life, such as restaurant recommendations and dating, into more rationalized, algorithm-driven processes. After all, many of us &lt;strong&gt;have lived hyperconnected lives that are broken up by jump cuts&lt;/strong&gt; across space and time, and we welcome any tool that can smooth our experience of a discontinuous world.

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about &lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/learn-a-language-you-wont-use-in-work/"&gt;learning a language you won't use in work&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because by doing so, you'll gain understanding of the "right way" to do things.  &lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/alan-kay-normal-considered-harmful/"&gt;Perspective&lt;/a&gt; sometimes worth a lot more than people expected. Celluloid is a Ruby project that seems to get async model right by taking ideas from Erlang and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining concurrency with object oriented programming, Celluloid frees you up from worry about where to use threads and locks. Celluloid combines them together into a single concurrent object oriented programming model, encapsulating state in concurrent objects and thus avoiding many of the problems associated with multithreaded programming. Celluloid provides many features which make concurrent programming simple, easy, and fun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatic "deadlock-free" synchronization: Celluloid uses a concurrent object model which combines method dispatch and thread synchronization. Each actor is a concurrent object running in its own thread, and &lt;strong&gt;every method invocation is wrapped in a fiber that can be suspended whenever it calls out to other actors, and resumed when the response is available&lt;/strong&gt;. This means methods which are waiting for responses from other actors, external messages, or other system events (including I/O with Celluloid::IO) can be suspended and will never block other methods that are ready to run. This won't prevent bugs in Celluloid, bugs in other thread-safe libraries you use, and even certain "dangerous" features of Celluloid from causing your program to deadlock, but in general, programs built with Celluloid will be naturally immune to deadlocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fault-tolerance: Celluloid has taken to &lt;strong&gt;heart many of Erlang's ideas about fault-tolerance in order to enable self-healing applications&lt;/strong&gt;. The central idea: have you tried turning it off and on again? Celluloid takes care of rebooting subcomponents of your application when they crash, whether it's a single actor, or large (potentially multi-tiered) groups of actors that are all interdependent. This means rather that worrying about rescuing every last exception, you can just sit back, relax, and let parts of your program crash, knowing Celluloid will automatically reboot them in a clean state. Celluloid provides its own implementation of the &lt;strong&gt;core fault-tolerance concepts in Erlang including linking, supervisors, and supervision groups.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resque is a single-thread, single-process, fork-based process. Running lots of them incurs serious swapping. There have been proposals of running &lt;a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/09/16/improving-resques-memory-efficiency/"&gt;jruby&lt;/a&gt; to solve this problem but looks like Sidekq and the upcoming Ruby 3.0 offer a cleaner solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidekiq uses multithreading so it is much more memory efficient than Resque (which forks a new process for every job). You'll find that you might need 50 200MB resque processes to peg your CPU whereas one 300MB Sidekiq process will peg the same CPU and perform the same amount of work. Please see my blog post on Resque's memory efficiency and how I was able to shrink a Carbon Five client's resque processing farm from 9 machines to 1 machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following post from Telsa, the new car making company, reminds me the challenges people used to have when Apple opened its own physical store.  And why the late comers like Samsung are also piloting their own physical store as well.  &lt;strong&gt;People still triumphs machine, branding and technology at the end of day, especially for ground-breaking new stuff&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time most people decide to head to their local dealer, they have already pretty much decided what car they want to buy, which is usually the same make as their old car. At that point it is largely just a matter of negotiating with the dealer on price. Tesla, as a new carmaker, would therefore rarely have the opportunity to educate potential customers about Model S if we were positioned in typical auto dealer locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why we are deliberately positioning our store and gallery locations in high foot traffic, high visibility retail venues, like malls and shopping streets that people regularly visit in a relatively open-minded buying mood. This allows us to interact with potential customers and have them learn about our cars from Tesla Product Specialists before they have decided which new car to buy. The Product Specialists are also trained to answer questions about electric vehicles in general, not just ours. They are not on commission and they will never pressure you to buy a car. Their goal and the sole metric of their success is to have you enjoy the experience of visiting so much that you look forward to returning again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is, our Product Specialists could not sell you a car today under any circumstances, as Model S is already sold out several months in advance and there is no inventory on site. All they can do is get you to consider placing a reservation. Our stores are designed to be informative and interactive in a delightful way and are simply unlike the traditional dealership with several hundred cars in inventory that a commissioned salesperson is tasked with selling. Our technology is different, our car is different, and, as a result, our stores are intentionally different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my goal to join the ranks of those excellent companies at WP Engine. With thirty employees, millions in revenue, a Rackspace-like commitment to customer service (we employ more WordPress experts per 1000 customers than anyone), an SEOMoz-like commitment to honesty and transparency, and a HubSpot-like obsession on introspective measurement, not just on marketing and growth but on customer happiness and retention, we’re experiencing fantastic growth, but in a way that I believe is sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it’s your turn to think about this with your own company. Is your company building something of lasting value? Are you valuing growth over sustainable growth? Are you articulating and then living up to company-cultural values which attract and retain the right sort of people who then turn around and create the right sort of product and service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Kay's 2009 talk in UIUC on what distinguishes us from frogs,  how to escape the pink normal plane, the power of outlooks, importance of expanding one's horizon, value of understanding the problem first before attacking a really hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target audiences are computer science students at UIUC but if you get started from 32:00, you should get right into the solution part if you are not interested in learning what's wrong with today's browser design and how it should be an OS first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the slides that interest me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inner people is driven by forces from inside and outer people seek approval from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instrumental people think today is the future, they maintain status quo and ideas/tools people focus on the future and believe today can be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner+Instrumental: dangerous. Some politicians and most dictators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner+Idea: who moves the history forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da Vinci is born with high IQ but Henry Ford was born in the right century with the knowledge ready for him. Hence Ford revolutionized how we travel yet  Da Vinci couldn't assemble an engine of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculus and Newton offered us some powerful tools that teach us how to see the world differently. Now a high school student can do things that aren't even thinkable in Da Vinci's time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook is very powerful because it helps us to see the world different. How to increase it? Travel. Think. Don't be instrumental. Think normal as harmful. Believe the world can be better. Escape the pink plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some universal traits anthropologists have found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take any of these traits and amplify them, you've got a killer business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carefully encourage and go after those "non-universal" ones. These are the things that separate us from frogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul MacCready was awarded the best engineer of 20th century for building the first human powered airplane that flew from UK to French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts started with an assumption, built a prototype, crashed it and try another assumption in another 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul started by constructing a really simple model, as shown on left-bottom corner, that allows him to cycle through assumptions and ideas within a few minutes. Hence he explored the problem space a lot thoroughly. He won the awards in simply 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I have all four of them squarely.  This 50% time on product and 50% for traction parallel thinking is certainly the approach I'd take if I have a chance to do it again.   BTW, he is writing a &lt;a href="http://tractionbook.com/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on this topic too. His co-author has a &lt;a href="http://justinmares.com/thoughts-on-paul-grahams-growth/"&gt;recent review &lt;/a&gt;on PG's "Startup = Growth" essay which echos what Gabriel has said.&lt;/p&gt;

List all potential channels of incoming attention and conversion rate from day-0. Then follow through the list.  Here is the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuTYwDzB4XSudGpFcE9lSWI4YzUwcnhKZnNoMktEdkE&amp;amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0"&gt;spreadsheet &lt;/a&gt;for it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our themes tend to be horizontal in nature and are often based on an underlying protocol, standard or market trend that we believe is on the cusp of widespread adoption that has the potential to drive a cycle of innovation and company creation for at least a five to ten year period. We try to focus on themes and their underlying technologies that are ready to be rolled out to consumers or the enterprise and are well beyond the science-experiment phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this concrete, some examples of themes we are excited about presently and historically include email, RSS, the implicit web and human-computer interaction (HCI). Because themes are inherently horizontal, they have often have applications in the consumer and enterprise markets and can be delivered in myriad ways, whether it is via a web site, SaaS, a gadget, an appliance or good old-fashioned downloadable client or server software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/themes/"&gt;detailed list of portfolio companies across 6 themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Union Square Ventures Investment Thesis explained</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/union-square-ventures-investment-thesis-explained.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-06T07:13:38+13:00</published><updated>2012-10-06T07:13:38+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-10-06:/union-square-ventures-investment-thesis-explained.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two stereotyped perspective of investing. One assumes that every year, there are about 10 investment opportunities for the whole industry.  So the investor's main job is to locate those deals and be part of it.  The other insists that there are certain rules on how startup works. So they try to find/curate startups following those lines. These two views map quite nicely into Peter Thiel's &lt;a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/23787022006/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-14-notes-essay"&gt;2x2 matrix of determinate/indeterminate and optimistic/pessimistic of future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an entrepreneur, I'm firmly in the determinate/optimistic area but well aware that unknown and luck is still a major part of the game.  Without any control over the luck factor, the best startups can do is to figure out the "right model" and structure your company accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for a concise, yet comprehensive, explanation of the key components for a successful start-up.  Yesterday, I finally stumble upon one.  Print this one out. Use it as a compass for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot lately about a piece I read in Stuart Brand's, CoEvolution Quarterly back in 1975. It's called the "Clothesline Paradox." The author, Steve Baer, was talking about alternative energy. The thesis is simple: &lt;strong&gt;You put your clothes in the dryer, and the energy you use gets measured and counted. You hang your clothes on the clothesline, and it "disappears" from the economy.&lt;/strong&gt; It struck me that there are a lot of things that we're dealing with on the Internet that are subject to the Clothesline Paradox. Value is created, but it's not measured and counted. It's captured somewhere else in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many entrepreneurs are a little crazy. That’s a good thing.

I think having an experience like the one that Noah had at Facebook teaches a lot of different things- not just who we are, but also who we’re not. It’s lucky, in my opinion, that he had such a pivotal experience so early in his career. It means that he’s free, for the rest of his life, to pursue who he really wants to be. Everyone should share that kind of experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not often for me to become interested in technology itself these days. But the discussion between git pull and git rebase has interested me a lot.  Not for its own technology details but more as a tool to either loose or strengthen an engineering culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not often for me to become interested in technology itself these days. But the discussion between git pull and git rebase has interested me a lot.  Not for its own technology details but more as a tool to either loose or strengthen an engineering culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git pull encourages a rather loose, relax and, in the long run, ad-hoc manner of team work.  This suits startup cultures quite well.   It's fast to learn and easy for people who migrate from older version controls like subversions to learn.  Engineers works on his own little branch. He has no reason to integrate with other people's code until the very end of one's little project is finished.  The commit history ends up having messages that describes more about the code and less about the reason and thinking behind this list of patches.  For example, if you happen to follow the resque project, you'll realize that &lt;a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque/commit/832fb9d696c4367ae17d99aaa2ef6b43268605c5"&gt;a commit message like this&lt;/a&gt; is not really that helpful. 7 lines of changes.  One line comment without explaining why the 'destroy' is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git rebase encourages comparatively stricter engineering culture. One has to pay attention to not only his code, but also the commit histories.  Projects like linux kernel uses it to enforce a culture of &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html"&gt; keep clean history&lt;/a&gt;. Linus even wrote up what a good commit would look like &lt;a href="https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface/blob/master/README#L161"&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;  I can see how this could be very helpful in a project where the code needs to be maintained 15 years later by totally different set of people.  A clean history, instead of a loose list of incremental functional changes, will provide more context in the long run.  As a sample,&lt;a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766"&gt; check out this patch&lt;/a&gt; by Linus for a firmware related patch. &lt;a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blobdiff;f=drivers/base/firmware_class.c;h=81541452887bd3ce5d868909e3fb753fb3d6b124;hp=e85763de928f096e46cbfd74abb69c064e5c2101;hb=ce57e981f2b996aaca2031003b3f866368307766;hpb=e1cc485262846dcad931bf85ee655cbbb815bfe6"&gt;4 lines&lt;/a&gt; of changes, 8 lines of comments on the commit.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Gary Panter's drawing tips - Be like a river</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/gary-panters-drawing-tips-be-like-a-river.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-03T08:59:48+13:00</published><updated>2012-10-03T08:59:48+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-10-03:/gary-panters-drawing-tips-be-like-a-river.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think it's hard to keep a balanced life? Check this one out. The ex NASA Space Shuttle Flight Director wrote how he looked back on 2002 when he &lt;a href="http://waynehale.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/ten-years-after-columbia-balancing-work-and-life/"&gt;seems to live a balanced life but end up costing people's life&lt;/a&gt;.

Certainly not directly but ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it; the job and all my extracurricular activities, it’s a wonder I had time to sleep.  I guarantee I wasn’t bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this walk down memory lane is not about trying to impress you; no doubt you have had similarly active times in your own life.  The point is that we started to miss critical safety issues in 2001 and 2002.  In early 2003 we paid the price for that inattention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ask you; in a high reliability organization, one which is engaged in risky, highly complex activities with cutting edge technology; how much time does any individual need to devote to making the activity successful and safe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing on my list of activities was a bad thing; without a doubt I was making a difference to my family and in my community.  Some life moments are inescapable; death of a beloved family member is one of those.  No matter how far in advance you see it coming, you can never be ready for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old saying “all work and no play makes jack a dull boy” also bears elements of truth.  Time for recreation and reflection is necessary to do ones best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in spite of all of that rationalization, a decade later, the regret over not playing a more important role, one that would have prevented the Columbia tragedy, lays like a pall over my memories of those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grew even bitter admitting that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are in a High Reliability Organization, you have to pay attention.  The more extreme the risk, the more difficult the environment, the more complex the technology, the more attention you must pay.  But life intrudes.  As the song says, there are planes to catch and bills to pay, and too there are little children to play with.  You cannot work all the time, and if the balance gets too far either way, a price will be exacted.  Once upon a time I wrote:  “pay attention, do good work, have no regrets”.  True, but far too simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 I thought we were paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I thought I was paying the right level of attention to the shuttle.  I was a Flight Director.  I was also a husband and a father and active in my community.  I thought I could do it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So work was a 60 hour a week job; it was always on my mind.  There were a thousand details to plan and decide and brief to management.  Even then I recognized that there were a million details in the shuttle business that I couldn’t participate in; there just wasn’t enough time or energy for any one person to do it all.  The folks in the shuttle program office, Ron Dittemore, Linda Ham, and the rest, they had a tough job.  Tougher than you know.  Tougher than I knew at the time.  Everybody played their part, everybody was highly motivated, everybody wanted the shuttle to succeed, and yet, within months, we were all to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  Listen and learn.  Maybe you will avoid failure.  But don’t count on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>It takes 4-year to find what you're good at as a VC</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/it-takes-4-year-to-find-what-youre-good-at-as-a-vc.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-01T17:57:13+13:00</published><updated>2012-10-01T17:57:13+13:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-10-01:/it-takes-4-year-to-find-what-youre-good-at-as-a-vc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say the same is true for entrepreneurs. It usually takes at least 2-3 years for a young and fresh entrepreneur to hit his own stride and know what works for him the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say the same is true for entrepreneurs. It usually takes at least 2-3 years for a young and fresh entrepreneur to hit his own stride and know what works for him the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In listening to both of them, I heard something that I have found to be true in my own experience. It takes time to learn how to be an early stage investor. You have to make a bunch of investments and learn from them. And you have to develop a strategy, a thesis, and your own differentiated style which people can then attach to you. In effect you have to build a brand and become known for what you do and how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this happens overnight. I think it took my friend about four years to hit his stride. I suspect it took the Gotham Gal about as long. Part of this is that is how long it takes to know if you've made a good investment or not. You might know in two to three years. But by four years, it is going to be pretty clear. As these outcomes start coming in, you can start to see what is working and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "what is working and what is not" is not just about your investment selection. &lt;strong&gt;It is about the fit between you and a certain kind of entrepreneur and a certain kind of target market and a certain kind of business model. Some investors are better at investing in SAAS companies. Some are better at investing in e-commerce. Some are better at investing in mobile apps. Some investors are better at working with teams that need a lot of help. Some investors are better at working with teams that don't need any help and want you to get out of the way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to figure out who you are and where you fit in the startup economy before you can become a good investor. But once you do that, you can "hit your stride" and start investing with conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have had my own humble share of fund raising, shake the hands of investors from China, US and Australia, the following article left a deep impression on me.  For anyone who is raising capital, please keep this one in mind.   To be fair, the most successful investors start out as entrepreneurs, like Ben Horowitz, Mark Anderson. But there are also non-trivial pencentage of investors who just haven't done it before.  When they give advices, I frown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of startups, it’s convenient to read the Picasso quote as a tidy summarization of the difference between critics (VCs and the tech press) and practitioners (entrepreneurs). There is some truth to this. When entrepreneurs get together, they tend to talk about tactical details. VCs and the press talk about trends, markets, and other abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Picasso was just being modest. He thought about the meaning of his art far more deeply than his critics did. The same is true of great entrepreneurs. “Cheap turpentine” is important, but so is “Form and Structure and Meaning”. The best ideas emerge from the interplay between the two modes of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long heard of the term "computational photography" where techniques like linear algebra could be used to transform one shape into another. But to see it in effect is still mind numbing. Checkout the following video where using open source software,  "people are removed from a space".  Think of surveillance devices. Think about using photo and video as evidences in court. We're truly living in an exciting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a process of foreground subtraction, the project removes people from a space which otherwise would be difficult to capture empty. Using either time-lapse sequences, movie scenes, or live video as the content, users are able to watch as the people begin to fade away and the background is reconstructed. The video below shows the image as it is being processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that building a startup team is hard yet crucial.  But given so many other factors that are involved in this brutal survival game, there hasn't been much research done on answering the question: &lt;strong&gt;what makes up the best team?&lt;/strong&gt; Shall we pick a group of really talented people and put them together and wait it to settle down by itself? Or maybe find a team that has done works together since they know each other much better so communication cost and team coherency is better? If the reality is somewhere between these two extreme sides, where is the balance point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I ran into one &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all"&gt;great and long article&lt;/a&gt; on this topic.  The article itself has many parts to it and it's not as smooth as it could be. But there are so many nuggets it it that I strongly recommend you reading it from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the answer for those impatient ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uzzi found that the people who worked on Broadway were part of a social network with lots of interconnections: it didn’t take many links to get from the librettist of “Guys and Dolls” to the choreographer of “Cats.” Uzzi devised a way to quantify the density of these connections,&lt;strong&gt; a figure he called Q. If musicals were being developed by teams of artists that had worked together several times before&lt;/strong&gt;—a common practice, because Broadway producers see “incumbent teams” as less risky—&lt;strong&gt;those musicals would have an extremely high Q&lt;/strong&gt;. A musical created by a team of strangers would have a low Q.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uzzi then tallied his Q readings with information about how successful the productions had been. “Frankly, I was surprised by how big the effect was,” Uzzi told me. “I expected Q to matter, but I had no idea it would matter this much.” According to the data, the &lt;strong&gt;relationships among collaborators emerged as a reliable predictor of Broadway success.&lt;/strong&gt; When the Q was low—less than 1.7 on Uzzi’s five-point scale—the musicals were likely to fail. Because the artists didn’t know one another, they struggled to work together and exchange ideas. “This wasn’t so surprising,” Uzzi says. “It takes time to develop a successful collaboration.” &lt;strong&gt;But, when the Q was too high (above 3.2), the work also suffered.&lt;/strong&gt; The artists all thought in similar ways, which crushed innovation. According to Uzzi, this is what happened on Broadway during the nineteen-twenties, which he made the focus of a separate study. The decade is remembered for its glittering array of talent—Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II, and so on—but Uzzi’s data reveals that ninety per cent of musicals produced during the decade were flops, far above the historical norm. “Broadway had some of the biggest names ever,” Uzzi explains. “But the shows were too full of repeat relationships, and that stifled creativity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best Broadway shows were produced by networks with an intermediate level of social intimacy.&lt;/strong&gt; The ideal level of Q—which Uzzi and his colleague Jarrett Spiro called the &lt;strong&gt;“bliss point”—emerged as being between 2.4 and 2.6.&lt;/strong&gt; A show produced by a team whose Q was within this range was three times more likely to be a commercial success than a musical produced by a team with a score below 1.4 or above 3.2. It was also three times more likely to be lauded by the critics. “The best Broadway teams, by far, were those with a mix of relationships,” Uzzi says. “These teams had some old friends, but they also had newbies. This mixture meant that the artists could interact efficiently—they had a familiar structure to fall back on—but they also managed to incorporate some new ideas. They were comfortable with each other, but they weren’t too comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uzzi’s favorite example of “intermediate Q” is “West Side Story,” one of the most successful Broadway musicals ever. In 1957, the play was seen as a radical departure from Broadway conventions, both for its focus on social problems and for its extended dance scenes. The concept was dreamed up by Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, and Arthur Laurents. They were all Broadway legends, which might make “West Side Story” look like a show with high Q. But the project also benefitted from a crucial injection of unknown talent, as the established artists realized that they needed a fresh lyrical voice. After an extensive search, they chose a twenty-five-year-old lyricist who had never worked on a Broadway musical before. His name was Stephen Sondheim.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Quote: Once an innovation is implemented ...'</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/quote-once-an-innovation-is-implemented.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-15T14:56:16+12:00</published><updated>2012-09-15T14:56:16+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-09-15:/quote-once-an-innovation-is-implemented.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon is a great company. So is Apple. Although they both have content, ie iTune vs. Amazon, or tablet device, iPad vs. Kindle. the two companies culture are dramatically different.  Their strategy to profit are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Twitter-_-alexdong_-Apple_s-goal-is-to-make-....jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://alexdong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Twitter-_-alexdong_-Apple_s-goal-is-to-make-....jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daring Fireball's &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/amazons_play"&gt;Amazon's Play &lt;/a&gt;has summarized most of what I wanted to say about this. So I'll just quote him out right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s goal is to sell as many iPads as it can. &lt;strong&gt;Amazon’s goal is to sell as many Kindle Fires as it can to a specific audience: active Amazon.com customers.&lt;/strong&gt; And for that specific audience, it’s a very appealing proposition. The &lt;strong&gt;Fire makes it even easier to do things you’re already doing&lt;/strong&gt; — reading Kindle e-books, watching movies and TV shows through your Prime membership. And the low prices speak to the heart of the Amazon.com customer base. When Bezos says he wants Amazon’s interests aligned with those of their customers, he means it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a &lt;em&gt;heads we win, tails you lose&lt;/em&gt; strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the brilliance. If you buy an iPad but use Amazon’s iOS apps to read Kindle books and watch movies through your Amazon Prime account, Apple wins but so too does Amazon. If you buy a Kindle Fire instead of an iPad, Apple gets nothing. Amazon wins so long as you consume media content from Amazon, no matter if you play it on a Kindle Fire or an iPad. Apple only wins if you buy an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReadWriteWeb has one chart that shows the huge d&lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the-difference-between-apple-amazon-in-one-chart.php"&gt;ifference Between Apple &amp;amp; Amazon In One Chart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/files/styles/610_0/public/fields/apple-amazon-profit-chart.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if short-term profit is all that matters, Apple is winning by a mile. Apple has generated more than $73 billion of profit over the span of this chart, while Amazon is around $2 billion. Some of that has to do with the relative size of the companies; Apple is about three times bigger, sales-wise. But Apple's approach is still dramatically more profitable on a relative basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there's also merit to Amazon's approach. By pricing its devices lower, it's potentially bringing its technologies to more people in different economic positions. Apple has lowered its pricing premium significantly over the years, but there are still potentially millions of people who could justify buying a $200 Kindle Fire but not a $400 iPad. Apple is now expected to launch a smaller, cheaper iPad, something it once suggested it wouldn't do - an action attributable in part to Amazon's success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Amazon's approach ever lead to substantial profits? If Apple and Google are driving media and app prices lower, that leaves less room for Amazon to profit in the future. But Amazon is a multifaceted machine, ranging from digital media sales to paper-towel delivery. It's possible that getting customers all-in on Amazon's digital and Prime services will eventually lead to greater profits across the board.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Long term view and broad strategy - Jeff Bezos interview at AllThingsD</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/long-term-view-and-broad-strategy-jeff-bezos-interview-at-allthingsd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-10T21:21:52+12:00</published><updated>2012-09-10T21:21:52+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-09-10:/long-term-view-and-broad-strategy-jeff-bezos-interview-at-allthingsd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people,” Mr. Bezos told reporter Steve Levy last month&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/ff_bezos/all/1"&gt; in an interview in Wired&lt;/a&gt;. “But if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow—and we’re very stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="380"]&lt;img alt="" src="http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/09/amazon_bezos_d_crop.png"&gt; Jeff Bezos at AllThingsD[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the Kindle Product series. Here is another excellent example on taking really long term view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a previous interview, you said it takes five to seven years for a new business to either break even or become profitable. And you are now in year five of the Kindle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bezos:&lt;/strong&gt; True story. Typically, of course, they vary a bit. We are in year five, but actually you could say we are in year eight because we worked on the device — the Kindle one — three years before we launched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that goes against common wisdom is about focus. It's really dazzling that Amazon is competing with NetFlix on video streaming, Walmart on retail, Google/Apple on mobile and leading the AWS service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone ever tell you that you have a focus problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bezos:&lt;/strong&gt; Hahahaha! That’s so funny because my Montessori teacher used to have to pick me up and move me from one task to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, no?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bezos: &lt;/strong&gt;So, no, I have never been asked that question. But I know where that’s coming from. I would say we do have a different philosophy from other companies — another common phrase is “stick to your knitting.” &lt;strong&gt;Our approach is, if we have a good idea, and if it’s something we think customers would care about&lt;/strong&gt;, like AWS or Kindle Fire, then we don’t ask why do this, &lt;strong&gt;we ask why not do this?&lt;/strong&gt; We have a high bar for doing those things. We don’t want to do me-too things. The people we’ve attracted over time to Amazon want to be pioneers. They want to be inventors. They want to do new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away? Do what makes sense to one's own company and ignore what others have to say.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to&lt;strong&gt; test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence&lt;/strong&gt; (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don't typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don't test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I'm extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different people will have different testing strategies based on this philosophy, but that seems reasonable to me given the immature state of understanding of how tests can best fit into the inner loop of coding. Ten or twenty years from now we'll likely have a more universal theory of which tests to write, which tests not to write, and how to tell the difference. In the meantime, experimentation seems in order.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>What’s wrong with universities database class and how to prepare for the future?</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/what-wrong-with-university-database-prepare-for-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-04T22:30:20+12:00</published><updated>2012-09-04T22:30:20+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-09-04:/what-wrong-with-university-database-prepare-for-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bestof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every computer science or engineering graduate has learned the basics of relational database. This will certainly include some "advanced" skills like JOIN, or COUNT with GROUP BY, or sub-queries and probably certainly TRANSACTIONS. Students believe that they need to use these features in their real work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every computer science or engineering graduate has learned the basics of relational database. This will certainly include some "advanced" skills like JOIN, or COUNT with GROUP BY, or sub-queries and probably certainly TRANSACTIONS. Students believe that they need to use these features in their real work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon's e-commerce site uses &lt;a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/consistency-and-availability-in-amazons-dynamo/"&gt;key-value, consistent hashing&lt;/a&gt; and "always-write-succeed", instead of transactions, as described in &lt;a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html"&gt;this ground-breaking paper&lt;/a&gt;.  Reddit, one of the world's most popular site uses&lt;a href="http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/reddits-database-has-two-tables/"&gt; only two tables&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they keep a Thing Table and a Data Table. Everything in Reddit is a Thing: users, links, comments, subreddits, awards, etc. Things keep common attribute like up/down votes, a type, and creation date. The Data table has three columns: thing id, key, value. There’s a row for every attribute. There’s a row for title, url, author, spam votes, etc. When they add new features they didn’t have to worry about the database anymore. They didn’t have to add new tables for new things or worry about upgrades. Easier for development, deployment, maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price is you can’t use cool relational features. There are no joins in the database and you must manually enforce consistency. No joins means it’s really easy to distribute data to different machines. You don’t have to worry about foreign keys are doing joins or how to split the data up. Worked out really well. Worries of using a relational database are a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of big data, it's very rare that the database these students will work on in the future will stay on only one disk. As soon as the data expands physical machine boundary, all &lt;strong&gt;those beautiful normalization,  join, sub-queries and transactions all become completely useless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare the students for future, I strongly recommend the universities also teaching the students these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to denormalize databases.  Teach them redis. Get them to think about how NOT to use lock. Teach them the master and slave concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain how&lt;a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding+Introduction"&gt; MongoDB's sharding&lt;/a&gt; works.  Let students work out how to pick the right index and keys to shard on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment with Google App Engine, particularly the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/usingdatastore"&gt;DataStore&lt;/a&gt; so the students know the basic of BigTable and think more carefully on how to pick the best row id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play around with Riak.  Think about how &lt;a href="http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html"&gt;vector clock&lt;/a&gt; works. What the "&lt;a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html"&gt;eventual consistency&lt;/a&gt;" really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/learn-a-language-you-wont-use-in-work/"&gt;Again&lt;/a&gt;, if you are a student and you have read &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the above paper.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I had a chat with one of our most talented engineers who could code front-end animation effect that I wouldn't even believe it's possible.   When I started programming, it was assembly. Then c, c++, java/c#.  The new generation of programmers, however, start with html/javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, the high level stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked him what he would love to play with, his answer was node.js. And that is worrying.  It's not that node.js is not cool.  Or it's not fast. Rather, it's the lack of the understanding of both &lt;strong&gt;low-level stuff&lt;/strong&gt; like paging and locking, which one can only learn by programming in C,  and &lt;strong&gt;functional programming&lt;/strong&gt; stuffs that allow building a complex system using macro and chain-up-functions.  So here is what I would recommend a junior engineer to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a firm grasp of low level programming concepts. &lt;strong&gt;Read the redis source code&lt;/strong&gt; and read the common unix system calls.  &lt;a href="http://pauladamsmith.com/articles/redis-under-the-hood.html"&gt;Redis: under the hood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.enjoythearchitecture.com/redis-architecture"&gt;Redis Architecture&lt;/a&gt; are two excellent resources to get started. Alternatively, read &lt;a href="http://www.nginxguts.com/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish_cache"&gt;varnish&lt;/a&gt; source code, which is reasonable well written too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To appreciate the beauty and power of functional programming,&lt;strong&gt; learn yourself some &lt;a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/"&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt; or erlang.&lt;/strong&gt; Clojure is more robust as a functional programming language with excellent jvm support. &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do"&gt;Erlang,&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand, offers a great lesson on how to construct a robust distributed concurrent system. This lesson will still hold true even if you're coding in C.  Like the &lt;a href="http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.co.nz/2012/08/getting-25-megalines-of-code-to-behave.html"&gt;Curiosity on Mars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup life is stressful. Whether you're the founder or the employee.  Facing uncertainty everyday will drain your passion and energy.  Slowly but surely, you will wake up one day morning and feel like doing nothing. Everything seems to be broken. The whole universe seems to evolve against you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bestof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup life is stressful. Whether you're the founder or the employee.  Facing uncertainty everyday will drain your passion and energy.  Slowly but surely, you will wake up one day morning and feel like doing nothing. Everything seems to be broken. The whole universe seems to evolve against you.  You could literally stare at the monitor for a while and forgot what you want to do.   Experienced entrepreneurs will take the pace very carefully so that they could have a sustainable productive day-after-day. Rookies will throw two 100-hour weeks and burned out for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been there many times. My first serious burn-out was so overwhelming that I almost gave up programming. I ended up traveling for 10 months before I recover and found interests in programming/startup again.  There have been many guides on "&lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-startup-founders-deal-with-burnout"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.inc.com/guides/growth/20792.html"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; avoid burn out". But the essence is the same. Indulge in something. Do something that's luxurious for time-poor people.  The harder you push yourself to focus on work and put down other parts of life, the stronger the bounce off will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I &lt;a href="http://danariely.com/2012/08/15/understanding-ego-depletion/"&gt;ran across this post&lt;/a&gt; from a behavioral economist.   The research is about junk food and weight loss.  But the lesson can easily apply to entrepreneurs.  Dan first defined the concept of "ego depletion"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, when we’ve said “no” to enough yummy food, drinks, potential purchases, and forced ourselves to do enough unwanted chores, we find ourselves in a state called &lt;strong&gt;ego-depletion&lt;/strong&gt;, where we don’t have any more energy to make good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the solution. Tl;dr: indulge yourself in something that's considered unhealthy, unproductive just to refill the bucket. Or just say to yourself: f**k it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/7769306054_42541331ce.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we escape depletion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine named Dan Silverman once suggested an interesting approach during our time together at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, which is a delightful place for researchers to take a year off to think, plan, and eat very well. Every day, after a rich lunch, we were plied with nigh-irresistible desserts: cheesecake, chocolate tortes, profiteroles, beignets—you name it. It was difficult for all of us, but especially for poor Dan, who was forever at the mercy of his sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was daily dilemma for my friend. Dan, who was an economist with high cholesterol, wanted dessert. But he also understood that eating dessert every day was not a good decision. He contemplated this problem (along with his other academic interests), and concluded that when faced with temptation, a wise person should occasionally succumb. After all, by doing so, said person can keep him- or herself from becoming overly depleted, which will provide strength for whatever unexpected temptations lie in wait. Dan decided that giving in to daily dessert would be his best defense against being caught unawares by temptation and weakness down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness though, we’ve all heard time and time again that if you restrict your diet too much, you’ll likely to go overboard and binge at some point. Well, it’s true. A crucial aspect of managing depletion and making good decisions is having ways to release stress and reset, and to plan for certain indulgences. In fact, I think one reason the &lt;a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds/"&gt;Slow-Carb Diet&lt;/a&gt; seems to be so effective is because it advises dieters to take a day off (also called a “cheat” day–see item 4 above), which allows them to avoid becoming so deprived that they give up entirely. The key here is planning the indulgence rather than waiting until you have absolutely nothing left in the tank. It’s in the latter moments of desperation that you throw yourself on the couch with the whole pint of ice cream, not even making a pretense of portion control, and go to town while watching your favorite tv show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the indulgence, whether it’s a new pair of shoes, some “me time” where you turn off your phone, an ice cream sundae, or a night out—plan it ahead. While I don’t recommend daily dessert, this kind of release might help you face down challenges to your will power later.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why vim uses hjkl as arrow keys and ~ for home</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys-and-for-home.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-24T20:26:06+12:00</published><updated>2012-08-24T20:26:06+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-08-24:/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys-and-for-home.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- code&lt;/h2&gt;

It's the only thing that carries startup over the long, dark and endless days in the &lt;a href="http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/shirlawsresources/2011/8/25/article-from-paul-grahams-trough-of-sorrow-to-infinity-and-b.html"&gt;trough of sorrow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our story. When &lt;a href="http://timbull.com/"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; and I started BinaryPlex, we had a clear idea on what to build.   It was called Tribalytic, basically Google Trends for Twitter.  We've manged to sign up quite a few paying customers. We've got a couple of companies interested in acquiring our big data analysis technology. We also lined up one of the biggest Non-for-profit company for a pilot.  In May 2010, Tim and I went to Twitter's first developer conference and even &lt;a href="http://timbull.com/reflections-on-start-up-life-week-215-san-fra"&gt;got invited to give a demo at Twitter HQ&lt;/a&gt;. Things are looking good from outside.  Except we were running short of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and I took on a consulting job for a couple of weeks and by the end of the second week, we had a long skype chat.  I can still remember myself walking on the squeaky wooden floor and tried to explain to Tim that I don't have any passion left for Tribalytic. I don't personally use it and I don't care what happen to it anymore.  I still want to do startup but I just couldn't pull myself together to push Tribalytic any further.  By then, we've already used up our capital reserve, struggle to figure out how to extend our runway and we don't know what we can do to change that situation in a short period.  That was a very difficult situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of that call, Tim and I were both very clear that we'd have to put Tribalytic on hold and figure out something else we want to implement.  We want to build something we could use everyday. And that was trunk.ly.  What we eventually got acquired for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/1613385099_a7e5c4a1d0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next 12 months building Trunk.ly, there had been 10x more dark moments. We were running even lower on money. Both of us started to rack up debts.  We've got 1M investment term sheet signed but the investor ran out of money.  We had to take on contract works and realized this is only making things slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we never gave up.  Looking back, we could be stubborn or naive. Yet We were &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; passionate about trunk.ly. And &lt;strong&gt;that passion was like a lighthouse to a lonely ship on a foreign ocean. &lt;/strong&gt;It gave us hope and strength to keep going. Blindly believe that we will figure one way out.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, a large proportion of those come from listening to the following podcasts on my way to work.  They are usually an hour long and provides opinions rather than just the news, which I can get from scanning through twitter, techmeme or hacker news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze"&gt;Build and Analyze&lt;/a&gt;: Marco and Dan talk about industry news, iOS, Mac and web development. Their comments on latest news like the &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/91"&gt;Twitter quadrant&lt;/a&gt; reveals a lots of thoughts that's quite fresh and unique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-venture-capital/"&gt;This week in Venture Capital&lt;/a&gt;: Mark Suster hosts this show with CEOs, established entrepreneurs, VCs and lawyers.  Different from the show above, the value of this one is less about the conversation itself since these are strictly on-the-record conversation.  I value the judgement call and value system they used to evaluate contemporary events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://thechangelog.com/"&gt;TheChangeLog&lt;/a&gt;: a pure programming show. The hosts Adam and Wynn are what you might call "cool kids in the heart of san francisco". So this is where I get to keep an update-to-date view on what the cool kids are doing.  It's Ruby on Rails and node.js heavy but also have good coverage of Erlang and Mac development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/"&gt;IT Conversations&lt;/a&gt;: This is a network of many podcasts and conferences including Velocity, Web 2.0, OSCON, RailsConf. The content covered here are more high level and quite in-depth.  Different from the "change log" show, this one is less about hard core programming but more on how technology is used in different field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts/manager-tools"&gt;Manager Tools&lt;/a&gt;: Where I try to learn managing.  It provides a todo-list of tasks manager is expected to do. What I like about this show is the idea that management is not a challenging task. Rather, it's just repeating the same best practice. Sometime I do find the examples they're using to be a bit more related to traditional industry instead of software development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been puzzled by one phenomena for a long time. I found that the board/investors seems to be fond of the idea to kick out the founder. My biggest problem with this is this is almost like uprooting a tree and cut off the thickest root. I couldn't understand how could this be a good idea at all.  Yesterday I finished class note from Peter Thiel's  Class 18: &lt;a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/24578683805/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-18-notes-essay"&gt;Founder as Victim and Founder as God&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a perfect explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is as simple as this. The founder usually follows an inverted normal distribution where their personalities sit at the extreme ends of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m582v99LFd1qbb0b4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as the main characters in history and mythology, like Oedipus, Achilles or Cessar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m583660dMh1qbb0b4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human's history is filled of a cycle between peace and chaos. The invention of scapegoat makes that cycle complete.  The cultures that last long all, in one way or another, invented the sacrifice concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m58384OQYq1qbb0b4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When time gets rough, the founder, especially the single founder, becomes the easy target and the perfect candidate for a scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5839kF6nQ1qbb0b4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter also talked about whether it's possible to delay or even avoid this process near the end of the article. His suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders should think carefully about how to preserve the original founding moment for as long as possible. The key is to encourage and achieve perpetual innovation. It is very important to avoid, or at least delay, the shift to a horrible bureaucracy where no one can do anything and everyone is circumscribed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you've decided to start your own business. If you are like many other first-time entrepreneurs, you want to build the next Google.  Or the next Apple.  You want to walk into a coffee shop and see everyone is using your product.  You might even want to "make a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've decided to start your own business. If you are like many other first-time entrepreneurs, you want to build the next Google.  Or the next Apple.  You want to walk into a coffee shop and see everyone is using your product.  You might even want to "make a dent in the universe".  There is nothing wrong about this.  This is usually the most long-lasting motivation for entrepreneurs when things go bad and one has to continue fighting.  &lt;strong&gt;However, if you start out wanting to do nothing less than taking on the whole world, chances are you will be disappointed.  There is no direct path to "change the world". &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will find a 3-step approach to build a startup. It might be quite different from the "go big or go home" stories you've heard or read. It might seem too humble and not exciting enough, but it's much easier for start a company this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: reach "&lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html"&gt;Ramen Profitable&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/strong&gt;  Paul Graham defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses. This is a different form of profitability than startups have traditionally aimed for. Traditional profitability means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it buys you time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It basically means your company is producing something people want and you are paid enough to make a living off that. It's not the final destination yet but this is a crucial step.  Once you reach this milestone, you suddenly become indestructible.  It doesn't mean you have a perfect product yet. But at least you have an infinite run way to fine tune your offering or try a different plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get to Ramen profitable, you should celebrate this by adding an extra egg to your Ramen! This might be a tiny step if you compare yourself to a company like IBM or Microsoft.  You may be surprised that you're already better than 90% of all startups,  which close shops in the first year of operation. You have chosen a market, manage to get enough funding to build the idea into a real product and have people found it useful enough to pay for it. (If the people who is paying doesn't even know you, go get another egg for your Ramen please. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving Ramen profitable does not mean you should stick with the same idea.  Many companies pivoted into a new direction which eventually make their name there.  Take Microsoft as an example. It was founded in 1975 to sell a special version of Basic interpreter called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC"&gt;Altair Basic&lt;/a&gt;.  But Bill Gates didn't stop there. 5 years later, Microsoft moved into the operation system market and released DOS and then Windows, two core products that helped to grow itself into a billion dollar company.  The essence here is as you reached this stage, you will have a better understanding of the market. You will be in a much better position to take on new opportunities when it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: own a niche&lt;/strong&gt;.  Become the number one in a market.  It's more important to be the number one in a small market than a number two in a bigger one.  We are living in a "big is better" world so this might sound crazy.  Who haven't read about Facebook's IPO and secretly wish he could be one of those 1,000 fresh minted millionaires. However, it may surprise you that usually a smaller market is actually a lot easier to conquer.  Dave McClure has an excellent short article talks about "&lt;a href="http://500hats.com/niche-to-win"&gt;niche to win&lt;/a&gt;" strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most startups think they have to be &lt;strong&gt;AWESOME&lt;/strong&gt; to succeed.  Actually, this is quite far from the truth – in fact, you can be &lt;em&gt;incredibly mediocre&lt;/em&gt; and still be quite successful. The secret is to find your &lt;strong&gt;Niche&lt;/strong&gt; – that is, the initial customer segmentation / product differentiation combo that enables you to beat your more established, mature competition with a much crappier product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the segmentation and differentiation, you need to own a niche market to get the time and resources to build a team, to hone your marketing messages, to establish your &lt;a href="http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/"&gt;distribution channels&lt;/a&gt; and turn your technology into a product. Your technology might work for a small group of early adopters who are willing to play with latest tech, but the main stream market requires much refined off-the-shelf product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a gap between the early adopters and the rest of the market. A premature expansion usually sinks the company by burning too fast too early.  When it really should carefully fine tune its offering and use its resources frugally. This idea is best explained by "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0066620023"&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;",  one of the best book on marketing and selling high tech product to mainstream market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: bowling into adjacent markets.&lt;/strong&gt;  Geoffrey A. Moore, the author who wrote the Chasm book, explains the next step in his other book called "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Tornado-Strategies-Developing-Hypergrowth/dp/0060745819"&gt;Inside Tornado&lt;/a&gt;". The basic idea is once you dominate one niche, the next thing is to expand into adjacent markets. Just like playing bowling, you don't try to knock down all the pins at once. Instead, you hit the first one at the right angel, then let the ball as well as the first pin to take down the 2nd and the 3rd; then all these pins will help to spread the force and take the rests.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>If you have to explain the difference between two features, one has to die</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/if-you-have-to-explain-the-difference-between-two-features-one-has-to-die.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-16T14:47:52+12:00</published><updated>2012-08-16T14:47:52+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-08-16:/if-you-have-to-explain-the-difference-between-two-features-one-has-to-die.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. I mean it. If you have two functions on your website and your fellow co-worker asked you "which one shall I use to do task X" and you have to explain to them "A is for this and B is similar but it does this.". It's time to kill one feature. It's just that simple. It's also one design principle you can hear me constantly speaking in work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design, by its nature, is like editing an article. If you have two paragraphs saying pretty much the same thing, will you keep both of them. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of square and Chairman of Twitter basically said "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hash/status/84417208385683456"&gt;CEO is the Editor of the product, the team and the story&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's NYTimes has an interesting article on magazine. It argues from a different perspective. Instead of the typical argue of value of creation vs. curation, it tells a story of the media itself. Here is the quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's NYTimes has an interesting article on magazine. It argues from a different perspective. Instead of the typical argue of value of creation vs. curation, it tells a story of the media itself. Here is the quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it doesn’t matter what you put on the cover of your magazine if no one will look at you. A few weeks ago, I was in a busy doctor’s office with a dozen others, absently paging through the magazines on the table. The table in front of us was stacked with the pride of American publishing, all manner of topics and fancy covers yelling for attention. Ever the intrepid media reporter, I looked up from scanning Bon Appétit to see what other people were interested in. A mother and a daughter were locked in conversation, but &lt;strong&gt;everyone else was busy reading — their phones&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the recent data from the major internet service providers are on a very strong uprising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook: 102 million people accessed Facebook solely from mobile&lt;strong&gt; in June, a massive 23% increase over the 83 million mobile-only users in March&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; 18.7% of its 543 million monthly mobile users don’t even visit its desktop site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eBay's mobile shoppers and &lt;strong&gt;mobile payers are 3 to 4 times more valuable than Web&lt;/strong&gt; only. Mobile was a major contributor to eBay's Q2 growth with 600,000 new customers making their first purchase through eBay’s mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp. 10% of Yelp's monthly uniques access the service on mobile but account for &lt;strong&gt;a disproportionate 40% of Yelp's search query volume.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your startup or company or product does not have a mobile aspect to it, I'd be worried.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>If You Build It, Will They Come?</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-15T21:54:21+12:00</published><updated>2012-08-15T21:54:21+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-08-15:/if-you-build-it-will-they-come.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once for a while, there will be some ground-breaking articles that come along. They would either redefine something I thought I've understood quite well, like &lt;a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/"&gt;Magic Ink: Information Software and Graphical Interface&lt;/a&gt;, or make something I always fail to grasp crystal clear like Paul Graham's &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"&gt;How to Make Wealth&lt;/a&gt;.  Recently, I have been reading &lt;a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup/"&gt;Peter Thiel's talks at Stanford's CS183 course&lt;/a&gt;.  None of the above are easy-reads but they definitely worth read several times to understand thoroughly the points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he talks about the engineer bias that leads many, including myself, to underestimate the importance of distribute your product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for whatever reason, people do not get distribution. They tend to overlook it. It is the single topic whose importance people understand least. Even if you have an incredibly fantastic product, you still have to get it out to people. The engineering bias blinds people to this simple fact. The conventional thinking is that great products sell themselves; if you have great product, it will inevitably reach consumers. But nothing is further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then went on to explain why most people thinks salesman are dishonesty and hence forgot we forgot president, investors, entrepreneurs are all salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are culturally biased to think of salespeople as classically untrustworthy, and unreliable. The used car dealer is the archetypical example. Marc Andreessen has noted that &lt;strong&gt;most engineers underestimate the sales side of things because they are very truth-oriented people.&lt;/strong&gt; In engineering, something either works or it doesn’t. The surface appearance is irrelevant. So engineers tend to view attempts to change surface appearance of things—that is, sales—as fundamentally dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is tricky about sales is that&lt;/strong&gt;, while we know that it exists all around us,&lt;strong&gt; it’s not always obvious who the real salesperson is&lt;/strong&gt;. Tom Sawyer convinced all the kids on the block to whitewash the fence for him. None of those neighborhood kids recognized the sale. The game hasn’t changed. And that’s why that story rings true today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales work looks like easy, just like everyone thought politician is easy. But in fact, there might be similar huge gap between a master and a mediocre player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy to the engineer vs. sales dynamic is experts vs. politicians. If you work at a big company, you have two choices. You can become expert in something, like, say, international tax accounting. It’s specialized and really hard. It’s also transparent in that it’s clear whether you’re actually an expert or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other choice is to be a politician. These people get ahead by being nice to others and getting everyone to like them. Both expert and politician can be successful trajectories. But &lt;strong&gt;what tends to happen is that people choose to become politicians rather than experts because it seems easier. Politicians _seem _like average people, so average people simply assume that they can do the same thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next highlight comes when he describes the importance of crack the nut of finding the most important factor in all the distribution channel under the sun and win it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a really bad idea. It is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. &lt;strong&gt;Poor distribution—not product—is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have great business.&lt;/strong&gt; If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. So it’s worth thinking really hard about finding the single best distribution channel. If you are an enterprise software company with a sales team, your key strategic question is: who are the people who are most likely to buy the product? That will help you close in on a good channel. What you want to avoid is not thinking hard about which customers are going to buy it and just sending your sales team out to talk to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also covers PR/Marketing, enterprise sales and a bit history of advertisement. But from an engineer-turned-entrepreneur perspective, the above are the ones that really nail it for me. Hope you enjoy it as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'Book review: how will you measure your life'</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/book-review-how-will-you-measure-your-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-12T14:06:28+12:00</published><updated>2012-08-12T14:06:28+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-08-12:/book-review-how-will-you-measure-your-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

If you haven't read that book yet, go buying one now and do yourself a favor by reading it cover to cover. It is literally the &lt;em&gt;bible&lt;/em&gt; in startup worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://harpercollins.co.in/Book_CoverImage/3306_Full_how_will_you_measure_your_life.jpg"&gt;Ok, back to the new book.  I was a bit surprised to find that he wrote a new book talking about life and family. "The soft stuff."  But I have to admit that I was secretly happy to see that.  You see, about 4 weeks ago, I caught some flu and became seriously sick. I spent almost a whole week on bed.  The body just gave up under me.  Even reading was too much work.  Since then, I've been in the process of recovering for a month.  I quite often feel tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working 80-hour-a-week for quite a while. This one-week-in-bed experience made me start wondering how long I can keep up with this lifestyle. How long I should wait before I start paying more attention to other parts of my life.  This book comes at the perfect time. It asked the right questions and forced me to think through some major life decisions I haven't made for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is his 20-minutes talk at TEDxBoston. It provides a good overview of the questions he covered in the book.  Notice the crane, yes, he was brought down after his cancer and lost part of his ability to write and express himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I was asked "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/diamondtin/status/233053668189020161"&gt;will you give this book a 5-star&lt;/a&gt;", I'd answer a firm yes.&lt;/strong&gt; And I'm pretty sure that it'll become one of the very few books that I will read again in a couple of years.  However I am not sure this book is for everyone.  It seems like it wouldn't be of much interest to the Alex a few months ago anyway. This is &lt;strong&gt;a great book for people who have already &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3225-what-are-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;got the question in their mind&lt;/strong&gt; for a while&lt;/a&gt;.  Here is some really eye-opening way of looking at the importance of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard it said that someone can’t be taught until they’re ready to learn. I’ve heard it said that way too. It makes sense, and my experience tells me it’s mostly true. Why though? Why can’t someone be taught until they’re ready to learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay explained it in a way that I’ve never heard before and I’ll never forget again. Paraphrased slightly, he said: &lt;strong&gt;“Questions are places in your mind where answers fit.&lt;/strong&gt; If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question – you have to want to know – in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an insight. He continued to talk about the power of questions. Questions are your mind’s receptors for answers. &lt;strong&gt;If you aren’t curious enough to want to know why, to want to ask questions, then you’re not making the room in your mind for answers. If you stop asking questions, your mind can’t grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Mobile user retention rate per category and app revenue by source</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/mobile-user-retention-rate-per-category-and-app-revenue-by-source.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-07T12:36:56+12:00</published><updated>2012-08-07T12:36:56+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-08-07:/mobile-user-retention-rate-per-category-and-app-revenue-by-source.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/26376/Mobile-Apps-Models-Money-and-Loyalty"&gt;User loyalty and retention rate per category&lt;/a&gt;. I is the best area to be since users there use the app more often and tend to stick around longer; III sucks as a category.  This provides a very useful way to "benchmark" your app to other similar apps and answer the question: is my average monthly user rate too low or it's just normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/88014/The-Great-Distribution-of-Wealth-Across-iOS-and-Android-Apps"&gt;Majority of the mobile app revenue comes from premium and in-app-purchase&lt;/a&gt;.  Clearly advertising revenue makes up small percentage of the revenue. Although it's the "fastest growing revenue category".  You can also see that the size of the app market grows 80% from 5B to an estimated 9B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Android is "suffering" seriously from the &lt;a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/85911/App-Developers-Signal-Apple-Allegiance-Ahead-of-WWDC-and-Google-I-O"&gt;platform fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.metafilter.com/about.mefi"&gt;Matt Haughey's talk on MetaFilter&lt;/a&gt;, he has one slide that says "&lt;em&gt;Beautiful visual design doesn't always win&lt;/em&gt;".   The story was that he paid someone to "redesign" the site. When the design is ready, he ran a test to send 50% anonymous user to the new design and 50% to the original site. It turned out that &lt;strong&gt;the old, "ugly" site outperformed the new design by 30%&lt;/strong&gt;. (Fast forward to 9:30 if you're in a hurry.  I strongly recommend the whole video, it's not only entertaining but also provides quite different thinking into building a community site.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of iPhone and maybe a bit overuse of the word "beautiful", this kind of thinking sounds like heresy. But if you take a look at the popular community sites like HackerNews, SlashDot or Craigslist, you'll find that they are all not-so-pretty.  I'm sure they are not short of resources to get a "better" design but they choose not to, why is that? I come up with 3 explanations.  Please leave a comment to share your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the more beautiful a site is, the less relaxed the user will be.  Hence less likely to participate. Community site is optimized around the goal of having people to hang around and talk to each other. Kind of like a party. Imagine you're invited to a party where there are a few Claude Monet paintings on the wall.  The ground is soft. The lights are adjusted to highlight the paintings. Will you spend more time chatting or will you feel guilty if your chit-chat breaks the mood that the paintings have created?  I suspect the same human feeling applies to online communities. If you want the users to feel relaxed and casual, you might have to make the site less logical, with less visual hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a distinguishable site makes it much easier to form a sense of belongingness. Or a sense of being part of something unique.   Seth Godin has a whole book to say about tribes. But the basic idea is &lt;em&gt;human beings can't help it: we need to belong. One of the most powerful of our survival mechanisms is to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of like-minded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging&lt;/em&gt;.  Those distinguishable sites define their own social rules. And these rules are translated into look-and-feels by the creators. So from this perspective, the HackerNews orange or the reddit moscot is similar to the feathers to American Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, these community sites are actually very functional.  Prioritizing visual design over functional or interaction design is a common trap that many designers fall into. Community site is all about the contents and discussions. These site designs serve this goal very well.  I have yet seen anyone who comes to reddit or HackerNews and couldn't figure out what to do next. Yes, comment threads can be long but it is almost stupidly easy to add one. And that is what truly drives traffic and bump average time-on-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said this, I think an utility like Facebook, iPhone or Mail.app should adopt a more streamline and strong visual language.  When people derive values by performing certain tasks, a stronger visual design would help to guide, or force, the user to go down certain pre-defined path/funnel.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>NYTimes now "supported by readers, not advertisers" and Facebook's real value.</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/nytimes-now-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers-and-facebooks-real-value.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-02T22:04:49+12:00</published><updated>2012-08-02T22:04:49+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-08-02:/nytimes-now-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers-and-facebooks-real-value.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July. 26th, 2012, NYTimes announced that it's now "&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/07/new-york-times-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers.html"&gt;supported by readers, not advertisers&lt;/a&gt;". This is a &lt;strong&gt;watershed moment in the history of internet&lt;/strong&gt;.  As digital content becomes more and more native in our daily life, people are willing to pay for good contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July. 26th, 2012, NYTimes announced that it's now "&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/07/new-york-times-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers.html"&gt;supported by readers, not advertisers&lt;/a&gt;". This is a &lt;strong&gt;watershed moment in the history of internet&lt;/strong&gt;.  As digital content becomes more and more native in our daily life, people are willing to pay for good contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the company's big three papers — the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;International Herald Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, and Boston_ Globe_ — print and digital ad dollars dipped 6.6 percent to $220 million, while circulation revenue was up 8.3 percent to $233 million. &lt;strong&gt;The historical rebalancing&lt;/strong&gt;, which occurred at the News Media Group for the first time in Q1, &lt;strong&gt;may indicate a sea change in an industry that has long relied on advertising to stay afloat&lt;/strong&gt;. "They're probably the first major paper that has crossed that line," media analyst Ken Doctor of &lt;em&gt;Newsonomics&lt;/em&gt; told Daily Intel. "It is an interesting moment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost at the same time, quite a few major internet brands suffer from non-trivial market value evaporation. As written in &lt;a href="http://www.dailydealmedia.com/789facebook-groupon-pandora-and-zynga-have-drained-almost-50-billion-from-investors/"&gt;Facebook, Groupon, Pandora and Zynga have Drained Almost $50 Billion from Investors&lt;/a&gt;, the author wrote the following about Facebook's performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soaring from a ridiculously inflated IPO price of $38 tagging $45 before reality set in. After a fantastic earnings report (sarcasm here) shares are trading today at $23.49 down only $ .22 on the day (.91%). That, my friend, is a loss of $34.4 billion in market capitalization or 38.2%. Tally so far – $ 34.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am amused by this stark comparison.  I still believe that Facebook is creating good amount of value, but whether that justifies such a high stock price is probably a different story.  I found the following analysis echoing with my past experience.  It basic posts a good question: &lt;a href="http://powazek.com/posts/3024"&gt;what if social networks value diminishes as the platform starts to monetize it? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every community-based site in the history of the web has essentially been a stab at creating a social network. Most of them fail as businesses, with the rare exception of small, lucky communities that become self-sufficient but not exactly prosperous. What if that’s just the way it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer tables, numbers and a little bit fundamental analysis, this article has laid the most solid, and technical, analysis of the "&lt;a href="http://www.econmatters.com/2012/05/whats-fair-value-for-facebook-stock.html"&gt;real value of facebook&lt;/a&gt;".   Based on the size of the advertisement market is "2.1% to 2.3% of nominal GDP" and the numbers disclosed by facebook, the author puts out the following table on projections in 2016.  We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people in the valley would say "Startup is for opportunists". &lt;a href="http://influencehacks.com/the-value-of-short-term-thinking"&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; explains why. Please read this one with a grain of salt since I think the scope for this one is mainly for technology startups that are built to take advantage of a new enabling technology. But still, it's good to see the point from the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technology, long term thinking is impossible, because everything changes so fast, and the pace of change is quickening. The rules are changing too fast. Nobody knows when a sudden shift in technology will open up new markets and business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we can do as entrepreneurs is take it step by step, and adapt quickly when we sense the market shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the scope a bit, I do think the team, the industry and the understanding of the target market shouldn't change over time.  The knowledge of why people pay for the service should stay the same.  The connections wouldn't change that much.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why release early is so hard and how to stay on course</title><link href="https://alexdong.com/why-release-early-release-often-is-so-hard.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-29T21:50:24+12:00</published><updated>2012-07-29T21:50:24+12:00</updated><author><name>alexdong</name></author><id>tag:alexdong.com,2012-07-29:/why-release-early-release-often-is-so-hard.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;- startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Release early" is probably one of the most important things that every startup should remember.  As a serial entrepreneur, I have inevitably pitched this idea many times.

&lt;p&gt;"Release early" is probably one of the most important things that every startup should remember.  As a serial entrepreneur, I have inevitably pitched this idea many times. So you can imagine how surprised and disappointed I was when I was asked "why it took so long to release?".   I have fallen into this classic trap of startup. I keep on iterating the product without releasing it to the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey,&lt;/em&gt; the Sirens sing a song so irresistible that none can hear it and escape. Circe warns Odysseus of the danger and tells him how to avoid it. He must plug up his mens' ears with beeswax, and have himself tied to the mast, if he wishes to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the last month thinking about how to stop myself making this mistake again. The conclusion turns out to be surprisingly simple. &lt;strong&gt;Treat "release early" as a religion&lt;/strong&gt;.  All the reasons that put off release could have reasonable arguments.  They would make perfect sense when you think of them as stand-alone problems.  But at the end of the day,  no matter how valid the points are, faced with the "irresistible tendency", we should probably follow Circe's advice and treat release early as an unbreakable belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My frist mistake is also the most common one: "one shot mentality".  I over-estimated the importance of the first shot. I worry that if we deliver an inferior product, if we get the color wrong, or the text not lined up properly, or the warning dialog box doesn't have the proper drop-shadow, people will remember these for the rest of their life.  You may find this laughable. You may ask who would be so stupid to waste time on these trivial things. Well, the world is full of people who are fanscinated by the &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/gcSStkKxXTw"&gt;icon ambulance story&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/programming-and-development/avoid-getting-buried-in-technical-debt/3849"&gt;don't accumulate technical debt&lt;/a&gt;.  As we sink deeper and deeper into the product, it's almost impossible to refrain ourselves from worrying about those details. Except maybe having a mast we can tie ourselves to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a deadline, it becomes a lot easier to decide which one is more important. Shall we support a close integration with facebook or implement an internal tool to track bugs because frankly no bug tracking system on this planet gets it right yet.  A deadline also acts as a "&lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html"&gt;shakedown cruise&lt;/a&gt; ". If anything major is broken like the founders hate each other, or the engineers want to stab the designers from the back or the idea is fundamentally wrong, the stress imposed by the deadline will help to shake these problems out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an artificial deadline is, well, artificial. Everyone knows it's just some date that the CEO grabs from thin air.  There is always a tension to push off the deadline a bit more. "One week, we just need one more week."   Unfortunately the longer the team works on the problem, the more they understand it and the more problems they can see. If the team starts to dogfood their own product, someone somewhere will always find some fundamental flaw in the product that needs to be addressed before the product can be released, like &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-2-support-ie6-ie7-ie8/"&gt;IE8 support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real danger here is who the product is designed for. The longer the product stays in the hands of engineers, the further it is steered away from the real user who might be using it.  PG once wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won't know your users. &lt;a href="http://reddit.com/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have no idea. No web startup does. And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. Better to release something and let them tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things could be even worse if the developer is solving his own problems.  For every improvement he does, he might alienate 100 other users who would otherwise use the service.  It's almost like we have to keep reminding ourselves that some random person on the internet knows better.  If we could put our ego aside and stay humble, this is exactly what "release often" and "iterate" mean. To listen to what your users ask for and build it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a deadline is not sufficient, the startup team needs to have some external expectation. For example line up some journalists and release the news of product launch date to the wild.  Or making the CEO the champion of external world in the team.  If he has announced the release date to content partners, channel partners, potential users or investors, he will feel personally obligated to meet the date. Hence making it much harder to extend the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
