      <h2>- bestof</h2>
<p>People ask me "why do you build <a href="http://choir.io">choir.io</a>". Yes,
the <a href="http://choir.io/player/f9c750f2bedb0c0f">Github Realtime Activity</a> 
demo is cool, but are you really going to bet your next startup on this?" </p>
<p>My answer is yes and this post explains why. </p>
<p>Five years from now, most of us will handle
casual computing tasks with wearable computers.  We don't know what 
the devices might look like but it's almost certain that we will be 
communicating with them using voice commands.  Google Moto X's 
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522054/moto-x-always-listening-voice-commands-new-notifications">"always listening"</a>
feature enables us to talk to the phone without having to launch an 
app. Google's voice search is finally fast enough to keep up with 
my natural speaking speed. </p>
<p>However, the options for computers to communicate back to us 
are still very limited. Your email client might play a ding sound
when a new email arrives. But the sound stays the same regardless of whom 
the mail is sent from and how important it is to you.  </p>
<p>Our ears are born multi-tasking masters. As I am
typing this, I could hear the heat pump's humming, 
the wind blowing the leaves and the light tapping of snow flakes on the 
window.  All at the same time. </p>
<p>We can also, almost effortlessly, notice changes of a sound among 
different background "noises".  Without looking out of the window, I can tell 
that the snow has just turned into a sleety rain, because the soft snow
falling sound has become much louder as the ice hitting the ground. </p>
<p>Sound is the perfect medium for wearable computers to talk back to us. 
Sound has a dozen of properties that we can tune to convey different 
level of emotions and intrusiveness.  Different sound packs would fit 
into various contexts. </p>
<p>This is where Choir comes in. Choir provides a programmable
interface to translate events into a rich set of context-aware sounds.
Our users mark events with emotions and intrusivenss and we take care of the
rest. </p>
<p>Is Choir too early for the market? Certainly not. Choir has three 
killer applications. </p>
<p>First, ambient sound monitoring. By associating user or server 
activities with different sounds, you can stay aware of the current statuses
without having to look at the graphs. If something unusual happens, you would
hear the changes almost subconsciously.  Failed login requests, rejected 
credit card transactions, 500 errors are a few good examples here. </p>
<p>Second, notify without interruptions. Today your notifications are 
mostly delivered via email or chat room messages. You have to bear the cost
of context switches to checkout these messages.  Choir can provide you 
with a more fine-grained control over different type of notifications. 
For example, you might choose to play a pleasant, low-intrusive sound
when a user gives a kudos to a support ticket, but you would probably want to
select a negative and intrusive sound, maybe a sea monster roar, if a 
user just unsubscribed from your service. If you hear too many of the 
scary sea monster noises, you will know something is wrong. </p>
<p>Third, celebrate with others.  Some companies would hit a giant
gone when they close a new deal. It is a great morale booster to bring 
the whole team together and share the excitement of successes. 
Now you could configure Choir to play a cheerful sound when a new paid
user sign up for your service. </p>
<p>If you are interested to give Choir a go, please request an invite at 
<a href="http://choir.io">http://choir.io</a>. You can also visit our <a href="http://choir.uservoice.com">support
forum</a> and tell us what you think. 
We'd love to hear from you. </p>
