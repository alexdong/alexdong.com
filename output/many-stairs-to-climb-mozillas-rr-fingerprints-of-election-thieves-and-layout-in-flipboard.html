<p>From Simon East's Rephotographing project. Simon scanned some 130-year-old
panorama photos of Dunedin. Then he built a beautifully slider 
interface that allows side-by-side comparison between 1880 and 2014.

<blockquote>
<p>rr aspires to be your primary debugging tool, replacing — well, enhancing — gdb. You record a failure once, then debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want. Every time the same execution is replayed.
Remember, you're debugging the recorded trace deterministically; not a live, nondeterministic execution. The replayed execution's address spaces, register contents, syscall data etc are exactly the same in every run.

<blockquote>
<p>In fair elections, a nation's voting pattern tends to feature one cluster, showing a general trend of voter turnout and vote for the victorious party (though some nations' regional voter preferences can distort it). Rigged ones show a cluster, but with a smear of votes toward the upper right for incremental fraud. Extreme fraud has a second, smaller, completely separate cluster at the top right corner, signifying up to 100 percent turnout and votes for the winner.

<p>The Duplo page layout engine searches between 2000 to 6000 candidate layouts for the best fit. It takes three steps to come up with a layout for a page:
1) create 2000+ layouts in a decision tree structure
2) select layout and apply content: It uses Branch and bound to shrink the candidate set, then it uses a dozen of heuristic like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a> to maintain an organic feel between pages. 
3) refining layout by aligning the DOM elements to baseline grids
