<p>Yesterday I posted the link on Google's new photo search and how "deep learning" makes that possible.  Here are some weekend reads on this topic.  The two videos focusing on different aspect of this concept. The first one explains the concept and the implication. The second talk covers how to use a large distributed computing model to train the multiple layers. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">What is Deep learning</a>: <em>Deep learning is set of algorithms in machine learning that attempt to learn layered models of inputs, commonly neural networks. The layers in such models correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where higher-level concepts are defined from lower-level ones, and the same lower-level concepts can help to define many higher-level concepts.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2538">Deep learning - The Biggest Data Science Breakthrough of the Decade</a> (60m video): This one talks more about the historical context and the Kaggle machine learning platform. Not particularly technically challenging but interesting enough since it provides lots of the applications of this technology. <em>Machine learning and AI have appeared on the front page of the New York Times three times in recent memory: 1) When a computer beat the world's #1 chess player 2) When Watson beat the world's best Jeopardy players 3) When deep learning algorithms won a chemo-informatics Kaggle competition. We all know about the first two... but what's that deep learning thing about?</em></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/52332329">Tera-scale deep learning - Quoc V. Le</a> (60m video): <em>Deep learning and unsupervised feature learning offer the potential to transform many domains such as vision, speech, and NLP. However, these methods have been fundamentally limited by our computational abilities, and typically applied to small-sized problems. In this talk, I describe the key ideas that enabled scaling deep learning algorithms to train a very large model on a cluster of 16,000 CPU cores (2000 machines). This network has 1.15 billion parameters, which is more than 100x larger than the next largest network reported in the literature.</em> (via: <a href="http://datascience101.wordpress.com">data science 101</a>)</p>

        <h2>- design</h2>
<p>(If you are looking for polarized rants as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>, this  is not for you.)</p>
<p>I love Apple. Before Apple, design was a luxury item that quite often was left to the last stage of product development. After Apple, it has become a top priority.  As an engineer with 15 years training in calligraphy, I feel grateful that Apple has lifted the public's taste for good design.  I don't think I am an Apple fanboy. I am just someone who gets a bit too easily annoyed by bad designs. </p>
<p>Having said that, I have to say <strong>I am a bit let down by the new iOS 7<sup id="fnref:ContextOfDiscussion"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContextOfDiscussion" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></strong>.  Yes, it is a totally new direction for iOS. Apple needs a few iterations to consolidate and refine the design language. Yes, each product needs time to catch up with the new direction. And yes, it takes efforts and compromises to provide a smooth migration path between the old and the new.  There are many reasons I can use to justify why Apple released these products at the current stage. However deep in my heart  <strong>I worry that I might lose yet another company I love and respect <sup id="fnref:CompaniesIRespect"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CompaniesIRespect" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></strong>.</p>
<p>To get started, there are some very well designed apps. Like Clock, Weather<sup id="fnref:ContrastOfWeather"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ContrastOfWeather" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and Compass. These designs have nothing loose or left unsettled.  Whitespace ample and balanced. Functions laid out clearly. No surprise. No guess work. Everything is where they should be. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"><img alt="Well designed apps" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/the-beautiful-ones.png"></a></p>
<p>Do keep in mind though that there are little design-tech-feature tensions here though. The feature sets of these apps are well defined so it's mainly a design exercise. So these are the easy ones. </p>
<p>Once we get over simple ones, I start to see inconsistent metaphors.  For example, here are 3 apps all offering the ability to select media from a library. I am particularly perplexed by the newsstand app. On one hand, its "store" sits on the bottom "frosted glass" toolbar, which is kind of new metaphor. On the other hand, it seems to carry with it the old skeuomorphism of a physical magazine stand. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"><img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/media-library-metaphor.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is another example. There are 2 ways to select from a range of screens. The left is the new "look-down" view on a list of open tabs in Safari. Flip up-and-down to navigation, click the small x on top right corner to delete. The right one is the new screen manager. Flip left-to-right to navigate, swipe to the top to close one.  I'm not sure why Apple releases two totally new yet visually so different ways for the same task. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"><img alt="Tab selection metaphor" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/tab-selection-metaphor.png"></a></p>
<p>Besides the inconsistent metaphors, I have to admit that I feel the new "simplified" interface maybe have gone a bit too far in some apps. </p>
<p>The logos feel a bit "too simple". They <strong>feel like the Apple logo without the bite</strong>.  The naughtiness has disappeared. Checkout the logos on the right of the "Contact detail" page and the ones in Safari browser's toolbar. I am sure we'll have no problem finding and using those buttons to perform the tasks but somehow I am left to want a bit more. I want "that bite". I want some personality. Something beyond a sleek and minimal design. </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"><img alt="Newsstand's new design" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/logos-feel-in-substantial.png"></a></p>
<p>The two answer incoming call interfaces below left wondering <strong>whether the "slide to answer" new design is a bit too clever</strong>.  One the left, the green square is clearly a button. Click to answer.  On the right though, the same green square requires a "slide".  It looks like a light will slide across the surface to indicate an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a> to "slide", but maybe it is a bit too subtle? </p>
<p><a href="http://alexdong.com/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"><img alt="Slide to answer" src="/images/2013-06-11-ios-7-im-feeling-1-dot-0/slide-to-answer.png"></a></p>
<p>I genuinely hope that all these shortcomings are either deliberate design compromises<sup id="fnref:IAmNoDesigner"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:IAmNoDesigner" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> or Apple is well on its path to fix them, as in all 1.0 products.  The next year or two will be crucial. The best case scenario is the company lifts itself to a new solid ground for another 5-10 years solid growth.  The worst case is that the company fails to consolidate and the gaps get wider and scarier. We'll have to wait and see. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/StandingOvation.MillerPage.pdf">Standing Ovation Problem</a> is a social science model that is extremely simple yet "provides a rich domain to explore the world".  Here is how a SOP is defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A brilliant economics lecture ends and the audience begins to applaud. The applause builds and tentatively, a few audience members may or may not decide to stand. Does a standing ovation ensue or does the enthusiasm fizzle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can watch Scott explains the theory in this <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking-2012-002/lecture/11">18-minutes video</a> but here is the gist of the theory. The following 6 factors have a strong impact on whether a standing ovation happens or not. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Higher quality</li>
<li>Lower Threshold: how easy the audiences are to be satisfied. </li>
<li>Larger Peer Effects: how likely the audiences are influenced by each other. </li>
<li>More variation</li>
<li>Use celebrities</li>
<li>Big groups. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The first three are self explainable and in most cases out of our control. What's more fascinating are 4-6. Let's dive into each one a bit more. </p>
<p>First, <strong>more variation</strong>. Let's say there are two groups. Each group has 6 people. Here is the number of other people who has to stand up before one stand up: <code>(1, 1, 1,  2, 2, 2)</code>. This basically says that for three people in the group, if they see one person stand up, they will stand up. The other three needs two people. Say we have a second group like this <code>(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code>. <code>0</code> means the person will stand up no matter how others behave and <code>5</code> means that dude is really reluctant to change his body position unless almost everyone is doing it. Which one of these two groups will be more likely to pull a standing ovation? Yes, the second one even though it has a difficulty score of <code>2.5</code> whereas the first group has only <code>1.5</code>.  </p>
<p>The difference? The second group has a more varied group so that a cascading effect can happen; also it has the <code>0</code> <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.html">movement</a> guy. Without any of these two factors, getting the second group to all stand up would be hard. </p>
<p>Second, <strong>use celebrities</strong>.  The model uses celebrities to describe the people sitting at the front rows. They are not necessarily celebrities per se but they share the same traits which is they can't see other people's behavior yet everyone else can see theirs.  This gives them the power as 'magnifiers'.  <sup id="fnref:Academics"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Academics" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Third, <strong>big groups</strong>.  If people come in groups, let's say the wife stands up, there is a pretty high chance that the husband would get his bum up.  If we have an audience like this one: <code>{1: 0%, 2: 30%, 3: 30%, 4: 20%, 5: 10%, 6: 10%}</code>, which is a group that's hard to please. Having a couple to stand up would be sufficient to <em>tip</em> the whole audience over even if no one would stand up without two other people do it before them. </p>
<p>To apply this theory to user acquisition is a fun exercise. If we have a software product that makes it really easy for people to have a link blog<sup id="fnref:WeAreBuildingOne"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:WeAreBuildingOne" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, basically to share interesting links in the form of a blog like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/">DaringFireball</a>, here is a list of things that could be done to help getting new user sign ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides getting onto the radar of big social news sites, finding many topic niches where people tie closely together would be important too. Say targeting niches where there is at least a forum for people to hang out. </li>
<li>Groups with larger peer effects would be the natural candidates. These are the groups where people pays lots of attention to each other and eager to jump onto the new bandwagon. </li>
<li>For each group, find out who are the celebrities and get them to use the service first. Then we can go after the other group members by leveraging the first batch of 'celebrities'</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:Academics">
<p>The people sit in the last role is defined as academics, which I find quite funny. The nature of the academics is that they can see everyone yet no one can see them.

<hr>
<p>Once in a while, I would read an article and found myself
keeps nodding my head.  Alex Payne's recent post <a href="http://al3x.net/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-young-programmer.html">A letter to a young programmer</a> is such a gem.
For quite a while, I have wanted to write about the four common myths about startup. 
Alex has managed to cover all of them. So here is my attempt to tell the same story
from my own perspective. </p>
<p><strong>1. Startup means working on brand new things. </strong>  Actually the startup world is 
full of people moving in herds. Majority of the times you will be working on 
projects that are applying existing knowledge to solve new problems. 
People who are doing never-seen-before stuff might have problems to get
attractions. Sure you have watched this video Pinterest's 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGgyma8cALQ">Ben gave at YC Startup School 2012</a>? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups are portrayed as an exciting, risky, even subversive alternative to
traditional corporate work. ... the culture of most startups is blandly uniform,
right down to a style of dress and grooming that helps “startup guys” – and all
too often are they guys – stay with their herd </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Working for startups are glamorous and always fun. </strong>.  One advice I often give 
to job seekers is to look for the words a job posting uses. If there are
an excessive usage of "fun", "exciting", be careful.  These could be cheap tricks 
like feeding baby candies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the company-provided keg runs dry, the free lunches are making you fat, and
playing the Xbox in the break room is no longer as fun as it used to be, what then?
When you find that you now report to a politicking middle manager and not the
inspiring CEO who interviewed you, will you still want to be there? Is a supposedly
novel working environment enough to sustain you? When everywhere you might consider
working looks more or less the same, is the novelty even there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. If you follow the lean methodology, you'll win. </strong> People say that my eyes start 
to roll over when I hear "lean", "MVP" or "agile". It is not that I don't think these 
are right ideas. Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it's a sin to expand the team 
if you haven't figured out your business model, user acquisition channel and costs yet. 
However, there are so much more than simply reparaphrasing the sentences in 
"Lean Startup" or "4-steps to Epiphany".  Startup is essentially a walk in the dark. 
You have to <strong>feel your ways</strong> and <strong>use your own judgement</strong> a lot. And no surprisingly 
the judgements get honed only when you make mistakes. Quite often, the more painful it
hurts, the better you learned. Reading 10 books wouldn't help a bit because you're
always interpretating the text from the old perspective. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups have been systematized, mythologized, culturally and socially de-risked;
reduced down to formulas and recipes. Yet, there is no enduring formula for
creativity and rebellion. When we attempt to factory farm innovation we breed out
the very thing we’re trying raise: the creative destruction that stokes and
re-stokes the fire of capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Startup means working your ass off and say goodbye to personal life. </strong>
Bragging of "macho heroics" of pulling a all-nightter will only make one look
naive. I'll still do it if the server goes down or there are some <em>real</em> deadlines 
I have to make. But I no longer do it because it makes me feel good. 
I've done plenty of those 36-hour non-stop coding thing and now looking back, I feel 
sorry for my younger self.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups appeal to a desire for daring that’s lost in many forms of modern work, and
we’re told stories of the rewards waiting when personal lives are sacrificed on the
altar of the launch schedule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarily, if you meet me on the street and ask "are you busy", I will be
very hesitated to say I am. Being busy is the same way to admit 
that I fail to use my judgement to prioritize things, or I am unable to leverage
