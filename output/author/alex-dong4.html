<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of movies, near the end of the hit film "Catch Me If You Can," there's a scene that Snowden might do well to watch while he's killing time in the airport lounge (or wherever he is) pondering his fate. The young forger, Frank Abagnale, who has been staying a step ahead of the feds, finally grows irritated and fatigued. Not because they are particularly skilled in their hunting, nor because they are getting closer, but simply because they won't give up. In a fit of pique, he blurts into the phone, "Stop chasing me!" On the other end, the dogged, bureaucratic Treasury agent, Carl Hanratty, answers, "I can't stop. It's my job."
Ultimately, this is why many people who have been involved in such matters believe Snowden will be caught.  ...
They'll have to make Edward Snowden their living, because those who are chasing him already have. Government agents will be paid every minute of every day for as long as it takes. Seasons may change and years may pass, but the odds say that one morning, he'll look out of a window, go for a walk or stop for a cup of coffee, and the trap will spring shut. It will be almost like a movie.</p>

        <h2>- code</h2>
<p>For the last two weeks, I've been working on an audit project for an Android app. 
I worked on Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE">WinCE</a> about 14 years ago. 
I am quietly impressed by how developer friendly the Android platform is. Here are a couple of
shell scripts I have written to make the reverse engineering process easier. </p>
<p>During our work, it is quite common to make some modification to the smali files 
generated by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/">apktool</a>, turn it back 
into a proper apk and install on the device to see whether our guesses were correct. 
This is quite a repetitive process that involves sign the apk, align the zip file, 
uninstall the original app and install the new one from local computer to the device. </p>
<p><code>Pack.sh</code> is a shell script that automates this process for you. It takes two parameters, 
the first is the folder where the smali files are; the second is the package name 
for the application, which is needed for us to automatically uninstalled the app from 
the device. </p>
<p>{% gist 6073781 %}</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a> is a brilliant tool that allows you to 
attach to a running process and see all the unix system calls it's making. 
Once you get it up and running, it is almost trivial to get a comprehensive view 
of the app's interaction with Android system, for example, 
which files it touches, which urls it requests. </p>
<p>In our case, the app would be launched and crashed immediately, leaving us no time
to manually attach a strace to the process to see what has gone wrong. <code>ambush.sh</code>
is a shell script that waits for a process to show up and automatically attach strace
to that process. This makes it possible for us to see what the app has been doing 
before it crashes itself. It takes two parameters too. The first is the pattern 
that <code>ps | grep</code> could use to find the process id; the latter is where the strace
is located. </p>
<p>{% gist 6034934 %}</p>
<p><a href="http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/18/android-runtime-strace">Benno</a>
has compiled a version of <a href="http://benno.id.au/android/strace">strace for Android</a>.
If you have <a href="www.busybox.net">busybox</a> installed, you can run the following command 
to install it from the net. </p>
<p _="%" endcodeblock>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
    $ cd /data/local
    $ wget http://benno.id.au/android/strace
    $ chmod 555 ./strace</p>
<p>Please note that you'll have to put the strace in <code>/data/local</code> in order to 
use <code>chmod</code> to make it an executable. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/07/16/authentic-design/">Authentic Design</a>: A good landscape overview to separate the concept of "flat design", "minimalist design" from "authenticity in design".  The author has done a good job guiding one through the history of design movements in the last two centuries.  I like his definition of authentic design. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its desire for authenticity, the Modern design movement curbed the ornamental excess of the 19th century, making design fit the age of mass production. </p>
<p>(In late 19 century) The idea was to highlight beauty of form in objects that were purely functional. For the modern design movement, decoration was not necessary. Beauty and elegance were to emerge from the design of the content itself, not from a superficial coat of decoration.</p>
<p>Authentic design is about using materials without masking them in fake textures, showcasing their strengths instead of trying to hide their weaknesses. Authentic design is about doing away with features that are included only to make a product appear familiar or desirable but that otherwise serve no purpose.</p>
<p>"Its artless shape gave it a certain naive innocence that suggested authenticity, just as the early versions of the Land Rover had the kind of credibility that comes with a design based on a technically ingenious idea rather than the desire to create a seductive consumer product." --  Deyan Sudjic commented on the design of the iconic Anglepoise lamp</p>
<p>Design whose beauty lies in function is not the same thing as minimalist style. With the former, the designer seeks to remove the superfluous, to make the product easier to understand, to make it perform better and to make the most of its medium. The latter seeks to create a minimalist aesthetic, to give the object an aura of simplicity and cleanliness. One is a fundamental principle of design, the other a stylistic choice.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to rigidly apply a minimalist design aesthetic to an interface as a style in the hope of making the interface simpler and more digitally “authentic.” For example, ruthlessly eliminating visuals such as shadows, colors and varied background styles would not necessarily make an interface easier to use. In some cases, it would achieve the opposite by undermining hierarchy and focus, which were established by those very shadows and background colors.</p>

You just modify a file and you're done. But with that flexibility comes with huge security risks. In fact the security holes in PHP has scared me away from wordpress into Jekyll.  This backdoor is possible because this strange decision to make a string replace be able to execute a file. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>preg_replace has a hidden and tricky option where if you pass the “/e” modifier it will execute the content (eval), instead of just searching/replacing.</p>

<p>When we do hit peak smart phone penetration, how might the app store dynamics change? It’s hard to know before it happens but here are a few thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited demand for applications should increase the average cost per install. This will drive developers to pursue apps with increasing monetization to support higher costs of acquisition.</li>
<li>We will have maturity in utility categories like email clients, phone clients, web browsers; some turnover in social networks; most turnover in games. Utilities tend to be downloaded by new users and infrequently replaced. But gamers swap out the next platformer as soon as they are bored.</li>
<li>Decreasing attractiveness of the marginal smart phone user in terms of ARPUU. New smart phone users will increasingly live outside of the most developed markets.</li>

<p>I have never expected this to be hard. Sure it won't be difficult to do this in 2013. But after sinking almost 1 hour into this, I decided to write it down hoping that it might save other people a bit time. </p>
<p>So I started with <a href="sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a>. I tried <code>sox zit.mp3 zit.ogg</code> and received an error message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sox FAIL formats: no handler for file extension `ogg'. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I tried <code>dir2ogg -q7 zit.mp3</code> which was recommended by a post on Ubuntu's discussion forum. But unfortunately, it still didn't work out. Here is the error message I got: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>dir2ogg 0.11.8 (2009-08-04), converts audio files into ogg vorbis.</p>
<p>WARNING: Mutagen failed on zit.mp3, no tags available

ERROR: Cannot open output file "zit.ogg": Permission denied
WARNING: No tags found...
}}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After much fiddling around, this is the final solution that was working for me. To chain <code>mpg123</code> and <code>oggenc</code> together. <code>mpg123</code> will generate a <code>.wav</code>  file to the standard output, which <code>oggenc</code> takes in and emit a corresponding <code>ogg</code> file. </p>
<p><code>for i in *.mp3; do mpg321 $i -w - | oggenc -q7 -o ${i/mp3/ogg} -; done</code></p>
<p>A few caveats: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>$i</code> is the filename and <code>${i/mp3/ogg}</code> changes the output filename. </li>
<li><code>-q7</code> select a level-7 sound quality. Since both mp3 and ogg are lossy sound format, converting one to another with the same sample rate would only decrease the sound quality. By specifying a higher bit rate, the <code>ogg</code> output would sound similar to the <code>mp3</code> file. </li>
<li>The <code>-</code> are quite important. </li>
<li>On Ubuntu/Debian, you might need to install the packages using <code>sudo apt-get install mpg321 vorbis-tools</code></li>

The nature never ceases to amuse us. But human beings are the true master of drama.  Monsanto seems to be doing really well by having an increase in its pesticide product and GMO seeds. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the main arguments behind creating these engineered crops is that farmers then need to use less herbicide and pesticide.  This makes farms more eco-friendly, say proponents of genetically modified (GM) crops, and GM seeds also allow farmers to spend less on “inputs” (chemicals), thereby making a greater profit.</p>
<p>But a new study released by Food &amp; Water Watch yesterday finds the goal of reduced chemical use has not panned out as planned.  In fact, according to the USDA and EPA data used in the report, the quick adoption of genetically engineered crops by farmers has increased herbicide use over the past 9 years in the U.S.</p>
<p>Both reports focus on “superweeds.” It turns out that spraying a pesticide repeatedly selects for weeds which also resist the chemical.  Ever more resistant weeds are then  bred, able to withstand increasing amounts – and often different forms – of herbicide.</p>
<p>At the center of debate is the pesticide glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto Round Up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I just noted, the great thing about productivity apps is that they add value, and the more you use them, the more valuable they become – the potential value of a productivity app is limited only by the amount of data you are willing to put into it.</p>
<p>The trouble for Apple – or any platform provider – is apps that cross that line from nice-to-have to completely irreplaceable. It’s at that point a user’s loyalty shifts from platform to app, and there are no greater examples than the aforementioned Photoshop and Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>Predictability and order are notspontaneous and cannot be left to the invisible hand. It takes a low-entropy carrier (no surprises) to bear high-entropy information (full of surprisal). In capitalism, the predictable carriers are the rule of law, the maintenance of order, the defense of property rights, the reliability and restraint of regulation, the transparency of accounts, the stability of money, the discipline and futurity of family life, and a level of taxation commensurate with a modest and predictable role of government.</p>

<p>On Dodd-Frank</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of financial reform should be to end this divorce between knowledge and power and ensure that most capital flows to the people who can wield it best, the entrepreneurs.  By contrast, the reform that was enacted, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, with 2,323 pages of bromides and legalese enhancing the power of regulators, moves in the opposite direction.  It increases the distance between the people in authority and the people with entrepreneurial knowledge.  It concentrates yet more power in the leviathans and their Treasury sponsors and Federal Reserve supervisors, and it imposes hundreds of new regulations on entrepreneurial finance.  Dodd-Frank sacrifices information on the altar of ignorant power.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On monetary policy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Could it be that the fundamental cause of the [2008 financial] crisis was that the monetary system, alone among the structures of capitalism, lacks a low-entropy physical layer?</p>
<p>“Over the centuries of monetary history, the remedy for unstable money has always been gold.  Critics who say the gold standard has been eclipsed by an information standard based on the Internet do not grasp the essence of information theory, which measures the information content by its ‘news’ (expressed in digital form as unexpected bits or entropy).  It takes a low-entropy carrier to bear a high-entropy newsworthy message.</p>
<p>“The 130,000 metric tons of gold that has been mined in all of human history constitutes the supreme low-entropy carrier for the upside surprises of capitalism.  Without guidance from gold, currency markets are subject to political high entropy.  They resemble a communications system without a predictable carrier that enables the information to be distinguished from the noise in the line.</p>
<p>“…Without a baseline of gold, entrepreneurship in the world economy degenerates into the manipulation of currencies for the interests of profiteers and government insiders.  This is a pathology of capitalism ….” (p. 122)</p>

<p>First of all, I love the concept of Bitcoin. I love a currency that's outside of the
the control of governments, or law enforcement agencies.  I love 
the built-in feature of fixed number of money supply.  </p>
<p>Around 2004-06, I had similar feeling towards P2P technologies. 
I spent non-trivial amount of time reading BitTorrent's source code, following
the latest development in Distributed Hash Tables. By then, Skype was this shiny little
startup from Estonia that uses P2P to achieve significant call quality improvement with little cost.  However, almost
10 years later, P2P still hasn't been accepted by mainstream. Yet. </p>
<p>I did a quick landscape research on bitcoin recently. My feeling is that
it's still too early for us to know for sure what might come out of this experiment.  The smeared reputation as a currency for buying illegal goods, the extremely low usage of 
the currency and the government's cramp down all reminds me what has happened to 
BitTorrent and P2P technology could happen to Bitcoin as well. </p>
<p>My conclusion is Bitcoin is overvalued but it will stay high as long as US keeps printing its dollar and China keeps loaning money to the US. This does not mean Bitcoin has a bright future though unless the mainstream starts to accept it as a currency for transactions.  Here are four good links I have found on this topic. Go reading them and form your own opinion. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/trends/bitcoin-industrystartups">Bitcoin Industry Sees More Investors than Startups</a>: The increase
of Bitcoin value seems to be a result of traditional money diversifying their "portfolio"
instead of driven up by real usage. (via <a href="http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein">@joshuabrustein</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With deal activity shooting up in Q2’13 as the graph below illustrates, there are currently more venture capital and angel investors interested in the Bitcoin space than there are actual investor-backed startups.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/how-the-bitcoin-1-manipulate-the-currency-deceive-its-user-community-and-make-its-future-uncertain/2013/06/30">How the Bitcoin 1% manipulate the currency, deceive its user community, and make its future uncertain</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We discovered that almost all these large transactions were the descendants of a single large transaction involving 90,000 Bitcoins which took place on November 8th 2010, and that the subgraph of these transactions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of temporary intermediate accounts, or split into many small amounts which are sent to different accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into essentially the same amount in a new account.” (source: Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph.)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68438.0">Topic: Current Bitcoins in "circulation"</a>: Due to the nature of Bitcoin and how many people hold it instead of using it, it is not surprising to see that it's hard to come up with an accurate circulation number.  I don't treat this as either good or bad though.  It's this inevitable nature of Bitcoin that might surprise normal people who are used to the concept of Central Banks and controlled number of money in circulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could have a million BTC in an address that hasn't been touched for 2 years, and then add 10 BTC to it today.  That shouldn't add a million and ten to the "in circulation" number; it should just add 10 BTC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/bitcoin-bits.html">Bitcoin Bits and the market</a>: Don't call me a Bitcoin critics because I am not. I want it to succeed. It is spirit lifting to see a real world market where goods can only be bought using Bitcoin.  Usage is the oxygen to ideas. I don't believe in any other alternative ways for bitcoin to gain momentum except to have more markets like this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is truly an "open air market". Folks were buying and selling Bitcoin for cash. You'd hand someone the cash and they would take out their phone and send you the Bitcoin in a mobile wallet to mobile wallet transaction. I also bought a Bitcoin t-shirt using Bitcoin sent from my mobile wallet.
There is something real and tangible about an open air market where the only currency allowed is Bitcoin. </p>

<hr>
<p>After reviewing this article, <a href="http://corte.si">Aldo Cortesi</a> gave a valuable comment on how Bitcoin is compared to P2P technology on usability and mainstream's inertia: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think P2P never caught on because a) it was never very convenient for the user, and b) it was stigmatized due to transfer of illegal/pirated content.
Structurally, Bitcoin has a better chance of actually solving some long-standing, existing user convenience issues. But its stigma problem is even greater than p2p, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However you decide to reply to a reviewer, several principles always apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be polite. Lashing out at a negative reviewer is not going to change their opinion.</li>
<li>Be conciliatory. If a reviewer is wrong, don't say they're wrong. Say "there seems to be a misunderstanding." If the misunderstanding arose from poor presentation, admit it and offer to fix it.</li>
<li>Be thorough. Don't dodge any points or refuse to answer any questions. If the reviewers found a flaw, admit the flaw and offer a fix (if you can find one).</li>

<p><a href="http://lisp-univ-etc.blogspot.co.nz/2013/06/lisp-hackers-marc-battyani.html?m=1">Interview with Marc Battyani</a>: There are high performance programming languages like C, there are highly expressive languages like Python. And there are Lisp, which is expressive enough to be used as a DSL to generate code for high performance systems. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Domain Specific Language Compilers and various other tools written in Common Lisp. [...] on 10Gb/s Ethernet market data packets coming from exchanges like the NASDAQ we process the IP/UDP/multicast network stack, extract the messages from the packets, parse/decode/filter/normalize those messages, maintain the indexed order book data structures, aggregate the price levels per stock, generate output messages and finally send them to a server through PCI-express or 10Gb/s Ethernet network stacks. The nice thing is that we do all that fully pipelined at a rate of one message every 12 nanoseconds! To have an idea of how fast it is, in 12 ns the light will only travel 3.6 meters (11.8 ft). Another way to view this performance is that the system can process 83 Millions of financial messages per second without any queuing.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968822">The future of blogging platform is ... a linking service</a>:  Well said. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The underlying value proposition by any sort of blogging engine (Posthaven, Medium, Svbtle, et al) is limited to a network, ease of use, and a good design. For most tech people, ease of use is a non-factor (you can extol 'distractions-free design', but you can put vim or Byword in full-screen mode) -- and I think the way people are reading is shifting away from individual sites and towards external services to the extent that design isn't a huge factor (everything looks the same in NewsBlur or Instapaper.)
[...]
I can't help thinking that the winner of this nouveau publishing spectrum isn't going to be a hosting service, but a linking service. You might never get Patrick McKenzie to blog on your platform (because why would he?) but you can always link to his material.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technology has lost its “golden child” image, with piñatas of Google buses being beaten to shit in San Francisco, invasions of privacy making national headlines, and an overall sense in the country that our leadership’s exceptionalist reputation as the “good” nouveau riche is not deserved and must end. To put it bluntly, the rest of the country doesn’t like us– any of us– anymore. We’ve lost that good faith, in technology, that allowed us to be rich (well, a few of us) and not hated, even in the midst of a transformational, generation-eating recession. 2013 will be remembered as the year when popular opinion of “Silicon Valley” imploded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recommend that entrepreneurs keep the funding amounts small in the early rounds when the valuations are lower and then scale up the amounts in the later rounds when it is a lot more clear how money can create value and when the valuations will be higher. This model has worked out pretty well. David Karp raised $600k, then $4mm, then 5mm, then $25mm, then $80mm (or something like that). And at the time of the sale to Yahoo!, he owned a very nice stake in the business even though he had raised well north of $100mm. He did that by keeping his rounds small in the early days and only scaling them when he had to and the valuations offered were much higher.</p>

You need to take care of employees, customers and yourself. It provides a clean slate for you to get started again. </p>

<p>It is a sign of great inner insecurity to be hostile to the unfamiliar.
Understanding is not a piercing of the mystery, but an acceptance of it, a living blissfully with it, in it, through and by it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H">Dagen H</a>: Dagen H(D day) was the day when traffic in Swden switched from driving on the left-hand side to the right.  The government and the public have done a thorough job that there was actually less accidents when the switch happened.  It's amazing that nowadays the governments seem to have less apetite for this kind of massive project anymore. 
Bonus: checkout the Headlamp sold in Sweden not long before Dagen H.</p>
