<p>List view is better for phones and smaller tablets because good type design
implies a single column to achieve adequate font size and line length.
Designing a magazine or card based grid for larger tablets or desktop is a
lot of extra work for platforms that are not as rapidly growing in market
share. We wondered if these grid layouts yield enough marginal performance
gain on larger screens to offset the cost of building and maintaining them.</p>
<p>A list layout for all screen sizes is beneficial for us due to the dramatic
simplification of design and engineering problems associated with our layout
engine and the tangential benefits extending from this simplification. A list
view is easier to make responsive on all screen sizes and provides a coherent
experience across web and native apps on all devices.</p>

        <abbr class="published" title="2013-11-30T20:49:00+13:00">
          Published: Sat 30 November 2013

        <h2>- fun</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwai_Point">Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter</a> is one of the 
largest industrial facilities in New Zealand.
Between 2008 and 2013, aluminium prices fell by more than 30 percent. The owner, Rio Tinto, has 
threatened to close the Tiwai Point smelter if it can't get a cheaper deal for electricity 
from retailer Meridian, or the Government fails to give it a substantial subsidy. 
The Smelter consumes about 15% of all electricities NZ generates. So there have been lots of 
discussions of what NZ should do if Rio Tinto does shut it down.</p>
<p>Here is a crazy idea. How about build a large a Bitcoin mining farm to use the electricity?<br>
This started as a <a href="https://twitter.com/farmgeek/status/406637109521305601">joke</a> on 
Twitter but after thinking about it for a while, it actually makes good sense. </p>
<p>Let's start with the technical side of the bitcoin mining business first. </p>
<p>You can think of the Bitcoin system as a global ledger and each transaciton 
as a switch from asset to liability in this ledger.  The Bitcoin miners play the roles of 
the central banks except that there are <a href="http://millybitcoin.com/how-many-people-are-bitcoin-mining/">thousands</a> 
of these "central banks" out there competing to perform the "clearing house" 
function for every transaction that happens in the Bitcoin universe. </p>
<p>The task of these clearing houses is very simple: they group a set of transactions together into a block,<br>
perform some checks and then put a stamp on it. The key step here is to "perform some check". 
This involves guessing a random number in, say, a trillion possibilities. There is no smart here. 
It's only about how fast you can brutal-force through all the possibilities and 
how cheap you can do this. </p>
<p>Of all those thousands participants, only the fastest one 
will win the transaction. All the rest, despite the fact that they might be half
way through, will simply throw away the existing work and start again. </p>
<p>Here, the speed is determined by two factors: pure luck and the speed of the guess. 
The luck is mathmatically gauranteed to be equal, or, more accurately, random. 
Even with the fastest computer, you might still lose to a tiny computer in one's garage.
You might think that this is a terribly competitive game to get yourself into. 
But it is a fierce competition only in the sense that it's a game of lottery
where only thousand of people buys and there are hundreds of chances to win
everyday. </p>
<p>So the real factor you can control is how fast you can guess. 
Once you've invested in the hardware, the main running cost is
the electricity bill, which Tiwai Point seems to have plenty of.</p>
<p>It's a common mistake to think that as we getting closer to the hard limit of 
<a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/161/how-many-bitcoins-will-there-eventually-be">21-million Bitcoins</a>, 
there will be no money left to be made for the miners.  Since a Bitcoin transaction won't 
succeed until it's processed by a miner. People who want 
a faster transaction, instead of waiting 7 hours, will usually offer a transaction fee.
According to the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees">Bitcoin website</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is envisioned that over time the cumulative effect of collecting transaction fees 
will allow somebody creating new blocks to "earn" more bitcoins than will be mined 
from new bitcoins created by the new block itself. This is also an incentive to keep 
trying to create new blocks even if the value of the newly created block from 
the mining activity is zero in the far future.</p>

        <abbr class="published" title="2013-09-30T10:22:00+13:00">

<hr>
<p>There have been a lot of articles written about the new iPhone 5 so here I will skip all the fluffy stuff and focus on four technical changes that have caught my eyes.</p>
<p>First, the new 64-bit CPU and the <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html">Object-C runtime changes</a>. This is the real deal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objective-C objects are contiguous chunks of memory. The first pointer-sized piece of that memory is the isa. Traditionally, the isa is a pointer to the object`s class. </p>
<p>ARM64 running iOS currently uses only 33 bits of a pointer, leaving 31 bits for other purposes. Class pointers are also aligned, meaning that a class pointer is guaranteed to be divisible by 8, which frees up another three bits, leaving 34 bits of the isa available for other uses. Apple's ARM64 runtime takes advantage of this for some great performance improvements.</p>
<p>Probably the important performance improvement is an inline reference count. On ARM64, 19 bits of the isa field go to holding the object's reference count inline. That means that the procedure for retaining an object simplifies to only one instruction instead of five. </p>
<p>My casual benchmarking indicates that basic object creation and destruction takes about 380ns on a 5S running in 32-bit mode, while it's only about 200ns when running in 64-bit mode. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we have the new <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/24/inside-apples-a7-chip-m7-motion-coprocessor-and-more-from-the-iphone-5s/">M7 chip</a>. This new chip makes it possible to use a few sensors without waking up the whole "computer". But if you look inside the chip, you'll see that it's only a consolidation rather than a revolutionary step as some media painted. It still doesn't include the "active display" or "touchless control" features that the <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7235/moto-x-review/4">Moto X</a> has. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>M7, which is actually an ARM Cortex-M3 part from NXP running at 180 MHz. The chip allows for low-power collection of motion data drawn from a Bosch Sensortec accelerometer, an STMicroelectronics gyroscope, and an AKM magnetometer.</p>
<p>After collecting information from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, the M7 performs some matrix math processing magic to produce an absolute orientation of the phone relative to the world. This data is then passed to the A7 in a neat package, probably in the form of three headings (roll, pitch, and yaw). </p>
<p>Using the A7 to monitor this sort of data would be mega-overkill, so the M7 was introduced to maintain a constant, low-power watch over these sensors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next is the <a href="http://www.multipath-tcp.org">Multi-Path TCP</a> support for Siri. (See the <a href="http://qz.com/126642/apples-ios7-includes-a-surprise-a-ticket-to-the-next-generation-of-the-internet/">qz coverage</a> for less-technical discussions. ) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. </p>
<p>Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother reaction to failures.
The multipath-tcp website also has a nice video demo of the technology. </p>
<p>We did a little demo of MultiPath TCP used over Ethernet/WiFi/3G on our Linux Kernel implementation. We start an ssh-session with X-redirection and launch xscreensaver demo on the distant MPTCP-capable server. We then turn off Ethernet and WiFi and thanks to MultiPath TCP the ssh-session is able to handover the traffic to 3G without interrupting the user-experience. Without our MPTCP Linux Kernel the session would simply stop working and the user would need to restart the ssh-session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last one is the two new background execution modes for apps. According to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS7.html">developer doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apps that regularly update their content by contacting a server can register with the system and <strong>be launched periodically to retrieve that content in the background</strong>. To register, include the UIBackgroundModes key with the fetch value in your app’s Info.plist file. Then, when your app is launched, call the setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval: method to determine how often it receives update messages. Finally, you must also implement the application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler: method in your app delegate.</p>
<p>Apps that use <strong>push notifications to notify the user that new content is available can fetch the content in the background</strong>. To support this mode, include the UIBackgroundModes key with the remote-notification value in your app’s Info.plist file. You must also implement the application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: method in your app delegate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chrome Apps amount to a Trojan horse for Google. By way of the Chrome browser, the company is essentially putting its own app ecosystem right on top of Windows and OS X. It’s a play that’s been months in the making. “There are still reasons why a developer would build a native app over a Chrome App today, but we’re working to tackle each one,” Rakowski says. Google began promoting a handful of Chrome Apps (then called Packaged Apps) in May. In July, its Chrome notification center was pushed out to Windows and Chrome OS users, allowing for alerts and pop-ups outside the browser window. And for months, Chrome’s developer channels have shipped with an app launcher that lives in the Windows taskbar — this launcher rolled out to the public today too.</p>
<p>The new apps look and behave much like the native apps you find on Windows and OS X. They’re built using web technologies, but also with Chrome-specific code that means they won’t be able to run on other web browsers — they’re truly Chrome apps. They can exist outside of your browser window as distinct apps, work offline, and sync across devices and operating systems. They can also access your computer’s GPU, storage, camera, ports, and Bluetooth connection. Chrome Apps are, for now, only available through Chrome on Windows or Chrome OS on a Chromebook. Mac users will have to wait another six weeks before their version of Chrome will be updated.</p>

I can see why measuring productivity is so seductive. If we could do it we could assess      software much more easily and objectively than we can now. But false measures only make things worse. This is somewhere I think we have to admit to our ignorance.</p>

<p>The only thing worse than this sort of activity is when people, students and teachers alike, run around college campuses calling each other racists and anti-Semites. It’s born of boredom, lassitude. Too cowardly to address problems of substance where such problems actually are, we  claw at those close to us. We point to our neighbor, in the khakis and sweater, and cry foul.  It’s ridiculous. We find enemies among our peers because we know them better, and their        proximity and familiarity means we don’t have to get off the couch to dismantle them.
Did I wonder if people would think we were selling out, that we were not fulfilling the      mission they had assumed we had committed ourselves to?
No. I did not. Nor will I ever. We just don’t care. We care about doing what we want to do   creatively. We want to be interested in it. We want it to challenge us. We want it to be       difficult. We want to reinvent the stupid thing every time. Would I ever think, before I did   something, of how those with sellout monitors would respond to this or that move? I would not.</p>

        <h2>- bestof</h2>
<p>People ask me "why do you build <a href="http://choir.io">choir.io</a>". Yes,
the <a href="http://choir.io/player/f9c750f2bedb0c0f">Github Realtime Activity</a> 
demo is cool, but are you really going to bet your next startup on this?" </p>
<p>My answer is yes and this post explains why. </p>
<p>Five years from now, most of us will handle
casual computing tasks with wearable computers.  We don't know what 
the devices might look like but it's almost certain that we will be 
communicating with them using voice commands.  Google Moto X's 
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522054/moto-x-always-listening-voice-commands-new-notifications">"always listening"</a>
feature enables us to talk to the phone without having to launch an 
app. Google's voice search is finally fast enough to keep up with 
my natural speaking speed. </p>
<p>However, the options for computers to communicate back to us 
are still very limited. Your email client might play a ding sound
when a new email arrives. But the sound stays the same regardless of whom 
the mail is sent from and how important it is to you.  </p>
<p>Our ears are born multi-tasking masters. As I am
typing this, I could hear the heat pump's humming, 
the wind blowing the leaves and the light tapping of snow flakes on the 
window.  All at the same time. </p>
<p>We can also, almost effortlessly, notice changes of a sound among 
different background "noises".  Without looking out of the window, I can tell 
that the snow has just turned into a sleety rain, because the soft snow
falling sound has become much louder as the ice hitting the ground. </p>
<p>Sound is the perfect medium for wearable computers to talk back to us. 
Sound has a dozen of properties that we can tune to convey different 
level of emotions and intrusiveness.  Different sound packs would fit 
into various contexts. </p>
<p>This is where Choir comes in. Choir provides a programmable
interface to translate events into a rich set of context-aware sounds.
Our users mark events with emotions and intrusivenss and we take care of the
rest. </p>
<p>Is Choir too early for the market? Certainly not. Choir has three 
killer applications. </p>
<p>First, ambient sound monitoring. By associating user or server 
activities with different sounds, you can stay aware of the current statuses
without having to look at the graphs. If something unusual happens, you would
hear the changes almost subconsciously.  Failed login requests, rejected 
credit card transactions, 500 errors are a few good examples here. </p>
<p>Second, notify without interruptions. Today your notifications are 
mostly delivered via email or chat room messages. You have to bear the cost
of context switches to checkout these messages.  Choir can provide you 
with a more fine-grained control over different type of notifications. 
For example, you might choose to play a pleasant, low-intrusive sound
when a user gives a kudos to a support ticket, but you would probably want to
select a negative and intrusive sound, maybe a sea monster roar, if a 
user just unsubscribed from your service. If you hear too many of the 
scary sea monster noises, you will know something is wrong. </p>
<p>Third, celebrate with others.  Some companies would hit a giant
gone when they close a new deal. It is a great morale booster to bring 
the whole team together and share the excitement of successes. 
Now you could configure Choir to play a cheerful sound when a new paid
user sign up for your service. </p>
<p>If you are interested to give Choir a go, please request an invite at 
<a href="http://choir.io">http://choir.io</a>. You can also visit our <a href="http://choir.uservoice.com">support
forum</a> and tell us what you think. 
We'd love to hear from you. </p>
