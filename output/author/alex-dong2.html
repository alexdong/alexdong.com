<blockquote>
<p>Some people say "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it". That's a cop out. Businesses manage things they can't really measure the value of all the time. How do you measure the      productivity of a company's lawyers, it's marketing department, an educational institution?    You can't - but you still need to manage them (see Robert Austin for more).
I can see why measuring productivity is so seductive. If we could do it we could assess      software much more easily and objectively than we can now. But false measures only make things worse. This is somewhere I think we have to admit to our ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only thing worse than this sort of activity is when people, students and teachers alike, run around college campuses calling each other racists and anti-Semites. It’s born of boredom, lassitude. Too cowardly to address problems of substance where such problems actually are, we  claw at those close to us. We point to our neighbor, in the khakis and sweater, and cry foul.  It’s ridiculous. We find enemies among our peers because we know them better, and their        proximity and familiarity means we don’t have to get off the couch to dismantle them.
Did I wonder if people would think we were selling out, that we were not fulfilling the      mission they had assumed we had committed ourselves to?
No. I did not. Nor will I ever. We just don’t care. We care about doing what we want to do   creatively. We want to be interested in it. We want it to challenge us. We want it to be       difficult. We want to reinvent the stupid thing every time. Would I ever think, before I did   something, of how those with sellout monitors would respond to this or that move? I would not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>participants were asked to predict the outcomes using either audio-only recordings, videos   with audio, or videos without sound.  Astoundingly, the prediction rate for those watching     without sound was dramatically greater than those evaluating with the sound.   In fact, those  listening to the music predicted the proper outcome about one-third of the time, the same as   chance.</p>

        <h2>- bestof</h2>
<p>People ask me "why do you build <a href="http://choir.io">choir.io</a>". Yes,
the <a href="http://choir.io/player/f9c750f2bedb0c0f">Github Realtime Activity</a> 
demo is cool, but are you really going to bet your next startup on this?" </p>
<p>My answer is yes and this post explains why. </p>
<p>Five years from now, most of us will handle
casual computing tasks with wearable computers.  We don't know what 
the devices might look like but it's almost certain that we will be 
communicating with them using voice commands.  Google Moto X's 
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522054/moto-x-always-listening-voice-commands-new-notifications">"always listening"</a>
feature enables us to talk to the phone without having to launch an 
app. Google's voice search is finally fast enough to keep up with 
my natural speaking speed. </p>
<p>However, the options for computers to communicate back to us 
are still very limited. Your email client might play a ding sound
when a new email arrives. But the sound stays the same regardless of whom 
the mail is sent from and how important it is to you.  </p>
<p>Our ears are born multi-tasking masters. As I am
typing this, I could hear the heat pump's humming, 
the wind blowing the leaves and the light tapping of snow flakes on the 
window.  All at the same time. </p>
<p>We can also, almost effortlessly, notice changes of a sound among 
different background "noises".  Without looking out of the window, I can tell 
that the snow has just turned into a sleety rain, because the soft snow
falling sound has become much louder as the ice hitting the ground. </p>
<p>Sound is the perfect medium for wearable computers to talk back to us. 
Sound has a dozen of properties that we can tune to convey different 
level of emotions and intrusiveness.  Different sound packs would fit 
into various contexts. </p>
<p>This is where Choir comes in. Choir provides a programmable
interface to translate events into a rich set of context-aware sounds.
Our users mark events with emotions and intrusivenss and we take care of the
rest. </p>
<p>Is Choir too early for the market? Certainly not. Choir has three 
killer applications. </p>
<p>First, ambient sound monitoring. By associating user or server 
activities with different sounds, you can stay aware of the current statuses
without having to look at the graphs. If something unusual happens, you would
hear the changes almost subconsciously.  Failed login requests, rejected 
credit card transactions, 500 errors are a few good examples here. </p>
<p>Second, notify without interruptions. Today your notifications are 
mostly delivered via email or chat room messages. You have to bear the cost
of context switches to checkout these messages.  Choir can provide you 
with a more fine-grained control over different type of notifications. 
For example, you might choose to play a pleasant, low-intrusive sound
when a user gives a kudos to a support ticket, but you would probably want to
select a negative and intrusive sound, maybe a sea monster roar, if a 
user just unsubscribed from your service. If you hear too many of the 
scary sea monster noises, you will know something is wrong. </p>
<p>Third, celebrate with others.  Some companies would hit a giant
gone when they close a new deal. It is a great morale booster to bring 
the whole team together and share the excitement of successes. 
Now you could configure Choir to play a cheerful sound when a new paid
user sign up for your service. </p>
<p>If you are interested to give Choir a go, please request an invite at 
<a href="http://choir.io">http://choir.io</a>. You can also visit our <a href="http://choir.uservoice.com">support
forum</a> and tell us what you think. 
We'd love to hear from you. </p>

<p>I did not premeditate anything. I just winged it, and when I saw problems I triaged them. The Slashdot system was very much evolved and not designed.   One thing I learned is don’t spend your entire life playing predictive defense against attacks that will never happen. Real people are very clever. If they choose to attack you they’ll attack you in ways you can’t predict.
Most people are just purely passive consumers, and that’s okay. I think a lot of people in this space obsess too much over trying to convert passives into actives. Some people are just wired to be that kind of person. Others aren’t. That’s okay.
With more and more voices, you tend toward broader subjects. Eventually it becomes less and less interesting. But what’s interesting to [me] isn’t always the thing that’s most lucrative. I had a pretty strong belief that the population of Slashdot users was relatively fixed. That makes for a crappy business model. You want to have a million really good users and be done?

Similarly, U.S.-based online photo printing has become a big deal, growing by about 20% annually between 2007-2012 according to market research firm IbisWorld. Three significant reasons for this growth are: the adoption of digital cameras, ability to transport photos online, and the increase in broadband and mobile Internet connections.

<ol>
<li>Asm.js is reasonably competitive with native C++ code on ARM. Even discarding the one score where asm.js did better, it executes at around 70% of the speed of native C++ code. These results suggest that apps with high performance needs can use asm.js as the target of choice for critical hot-path code, achieving near native performance.</li>
<li>Asm.js competes very well on mobile performance compared to Dalvik. Even throwing out the benchmarks that are highly favourable to asm.js (binary-trees and fasta), there seems to be a consistent 10-50% speedup over comparable Dalvik code.</li>

<p>In the context of mass surveillance, however, the RSA key exchange is a serious liability. Your adversaries might not have your private key today, but what they can do now is record all your encrypted traffic. Eventually, they might obtain the key in one way or another (e.g., by bribing someone, obtaining a warrant, or by breaking the key after sufficient technology advances) and, at that time, they will be able to go back in time to decrypt everything.

but generates session keys in such a way that only the two parties involved in the communication can obtain them. No one else can, even if they have access to the server's private key. 
The article provides a good entry-leve description to SSL's support of 
Forward Secrecy using DHE and ECDHE algorithm.  The author also has a follow-up 
post on how to configure Apache, Nginx and OpenSSL to support Forward Secrecy. </p>

<p>Recently I came across a suggestion on <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8300/ideas-for-daily-exercises-to-improve-photography-technique">ideas for daily excercises to improve
photography technique</a>. 
Here are the main ideas from "art school's true exercises": </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Take n pictures of a single object, making sure that no two were the same (n was generally some large number like '100' or '250') - 
   The exercise was designed to train yourself to begin to see the many ways it's possible to approach a subject...</li>
<li>Find an object and take the exact same picture of it every hour for 24 hours (generally an inanimate object... ) - 
   The goal was to see how even something that doesn't move changes quite radically depending on what is going on around it.</li>
<li>Take 100 pictures of objects that have a common characteristic (they're all buildings, they're all less than 1 inch wide, 
   they're all blue, etc.) - The goal was to learn how to find interesting pictures 'hiding inside' everyday objects.</li>
<li>Take 100 pictures from a perspective you wouldn't normally think to take pictures from (lying down, under water, 
   upside down, cropped to 1x6, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think these four steps could be mapped to the similar process in learning and mastering the art of programming, ie 
learning your tool, understand the context, form your own opinion and open up to new ideas. </p>
