<p>The following post from Telsa, the new car making company, reminds me the challenges people used to have when Apple opened its own physical store.  And why the late comers like Samsung are also piloting their own physical store as well.  <strong>People still triumphs machine, branding and technology at the end of day, especially for ground-breaking new stuff</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the time most people decide to head to their local dealer, they have already pretty much decided what car they want to buy, which is usually the same make as their old car. At that point it is largely just a matter of negotiating with the dealer on price. Tesla, as a new carmaker, would therefore rarely have the opportunity to educate potential customers about Model S if we were positioned in typical auto dealer locations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why we are deliberately positioning our store and gallery locations in high foot traffic, high visibility retail venues, like malls and shopping streets that people regularly visit in a relatively open-minded buying mood. This allows us to interact with potential customers and have them learn about our cars from Tesla Product Specialists before they have decided which new car to buy. The Product Specialists are also trained to answer questions about electric vehicles in general, not just ours. They are not on commission and they will never pressure you to buy a car. Their goal and the sole metric of their success is to have you enjoy the experience of visiting so much that you look forward to returning again.</p>
<p>As it is, our Product Specialists could not sell you a car today under any circumstances, as Model S is already sold out several months in advance and there is no inventory on site. All they can do is get you to consider placing a reservation. Our stores are designed to be informative and interactive in a delightful way and are simply unlike the traditional dealership with several hundred cars in inventory that a commissioned salesperson is tasked with selling. Our technology is different, our car is different, and, as a result, our stores are intentionally different.</p>

<p>I do see companies that are sustainable even with high growth, like HubSpot whose <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/chaos-at-start.html">revenue curve is as predictable</a> as a plot on your TI-90 while also able to <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/54126/Video-of-Dharmesh-Shah-at-Business-of-Software-2010-Conference.aspx">obsess over customer satisfaction and retention</a>, or like Freshbooks who maintains an enviable corporate culture in addition to an unflagging revenue curve, or like SEOMoz whose insistence on <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/about/mission">TAGFEE</a> wins over employees, customers, <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2012/05/seomoz-tagfee-and-me.html">and investors</a> alike, creating consistent growth even in the tumultuous market of SEO tools, or like Rackspace whose maniacal obsession with excellence in customer service allows them to charge premium prices and sustain an amazing 30% annual growth even at the massive scale of $1b in revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>It’s my goal to join the ranks of those excellent companies at WP Engine. With thirty employees, millions in revenue, a Rackspace-like commitment to customer service (we employ more WordPress experts per 1000 customers than anyone), an SEOMoz-like commitment to honesty and transparency, and a HubSpot-like obsession on introspective measurement, not just on marketing and growth but on customer happiness and retention, we’re experiencing fantastic growth, but in a way that I believe is sustainable.</p>
<p>So now it’s your turn to think about this with your own company. Is your company building something of lasting value? Are you valuing growth over sustainable growth? Are you articulating and then living up to company-cultural values which attract and retain the right sort of people who then turn around and create the right sort of product and service?</p>

<p>I bought Zephyr an 11' air. I have been using it for the last 24 hours. Loving it. I think the size makes a, surprisingly, huge difference. It's so small that I notice myself put it away a lot. I think even better now given the subtle change of its size.</p>

<p>Alan Kay's 2009 talk in UIUC on what distinguishes us from frogs,  how to escape the pink normal plane, the power of outlooks, importance of expanding one's horizon, value of understanding the problem first before attacking a really hard problem.</p>
<p>The target audiences are computer science students at UIUC but if you get started from 32:00, you should get right into the solution part if you are not interested in learning what's wrong with today's browser design and how it should be an OS first.</p>

<li>
<p>Inner people is driven by forces from inside and outer people seek approval from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instrumental people think today is the future, they maintain status quo and ideas/tools people focus on the future and believe today can be better.</p>

<p>Inner+Instrumental: dangerous. Some politicians and most dictators.</p>

<p>Inner+Idea: who moves the history forward.</p>

<p>Da Vinci is born with high IQ but Henry Ford was born in the right century with the knowledge ready for him. Hence Ford revolutionized how we travel yet  Da Vinci couldn't assemble an engine of his own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculus and Newton offered us some powerful tools that teach us how to see the world differently. Now a high school student can do things that aren't even thinkable in Da Vinci's time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outlook is very powerful because it helps us to see the world different. How to increase it? Travel. Think. Don't be instrumental. Think normal as harmful. Believe the world can be better. Escape the pink plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some universal traits anthropologists have found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take any of these traits and amplify them, you've got a killer business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully encourage and go after those "non-universal" ones. These are the things that separate us from frogs.</p>

<p>Paul MacCready was awarded the best engineer of 20th century for building the first human powered airplane that flew from UK to French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previous attempts started with an assumption, built a prototype, crashed it and try another assumption in another 18 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul started by constructing a really simple model, as shown on left-bottom corner, that allows him to cycle through assumptions and ideas within a few minutes. Hence he explored the problem space a lot thoroughly. He won the awards in simply 5 years.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Ran into a few posts about startup traction and the concept of quant based market. Thought it might benefit some readers of this blog. (If you haven't read my previous post of <a href="http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/">distribution channels,</a> you should.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gabriel from DuckDuckGo has two nice articles on this topic.  "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">How to move the needle</a>" talks about traction for different growth period and "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">Traction mistakes</a>" lists 4 common mistakes people make. I have all four of them squarely.  This 50% time on product and 50% for traction parallel thinking is certainly the approach I'd take if I have a chance to do it again.   BTW, he is writing a <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">book</a> on this topic too. His co-author has a <a href="http://justinmares.com/thoughts-on-paul-grahams-growth/">recent review </a>on PG's "Startup = Growth" essay which echos what Gabriel has said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noah Kagan who did the original marketing work for mint.com has an interesting post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2010/07/15/quant-based-marketing-for-pre-launch-start-ups/">Quant Based Marketing</a>.  The basic idea is pretty simple. List all potential channels of incoming attention and conversion rate from day-0. Then follow through the list.  Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuTYwDzB4XSudGpFcE9lSWI4YzUwcnhKZnNoMktEdkE&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0">spreadsheet </a>for it.

<p>A couple of days ago, I blogged about the<a href="http://alexdong.com/union-square-ventures-investment-thesis-explained/"> investment philosophy of USV</a> from NYC.   Here is a similar piece from the Colorado based Foundry Group.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2008/03/what-is-thematic-investing/">This article explains</a> 2 things: "what types of companies do you guys like to invest in? and what sectors do you find interesting?”Here is a quick excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our themes tend to be horizontal in nature and are often based on an underlying protocol, standard or market trend that we believe is on the cusp of widespread adoption that has the potential to drive a cycle of innovation and company creation for at least a five to ten year period. We try to focus on themes and their underlying technologies that are ready to be rolled out to consumers or the enterprise and are well beyond the science-experiment phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make this concrete, some examples of themes we are excited about presently and historically include email, RSS, the implicit web and human-computer interaction (HCI). Because themes are inherently horizontal, they have often have applications in the consumer and enterprise markets and can be delivered in myriad ways, whether it is via a web site, SaaS, a gadget, an appliance or good old-fashioned downloadable client or server software.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/themes/">detailed list of portfolio companies across 6 themes</a>.</p>

<p>There are two stereotyped perspective of investing. One assumes that every year, there are about 10 investment opportunities for the whole industry.  So the investor's main job is to locate those deals and be part of it.  The other insists that there are certain rules on how startup works. So they try to find/curate startups following those lines. These two views map quite nicely into Peter Thiel's <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/23787022006/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-14-notes-essay">2x2 matrix of determinate/indeterminate and optimistic/pessimistic of future</a>.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I'm firmly in the determinate/optimistic area but well aware that unknown and luck is still a major part of the game.  Without any control over the luck factor, the best startups can do is to figure out the "right model" and structure your company accordingly.</p>
<p>I have been looking for a concise, yet comprehensive, explanation of the key components for a successful start-up.  Yesterday, I finally stumble upon one.  Print this one out. Use it as a compass for your business.</p>

<p>Large networks of engaged users, differentiated through user experience, and defensible through network effects.</p>
