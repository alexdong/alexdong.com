        <p>Within Amazon, powerpoint presentations are never used in meetings.
Instead, employees are required to write six-page narratives laying out
their points in prose and "staff meetings at Amazon begin with 30
minutes of silent reading". This is so strange that I decided to find
out more about it, with the end goal of seeing whether we should apply
this practice in our business.  </p>
<p>First, the benefits.</p>
<p>Benefit #1: Provide more context. The story-telling narrative helps to
tie all the numbers and analysis into a coherent story, providing an
opportunity to review the core data going into a decision and share the
process that leads to the final decision. </p>
<p>Benefit #2: Accelerate knowledge sharing. A collection of these
well-written documents enable everyone in the company to internalise a
whole new space within 30 minutes of reading. Greatly optimising how
quickly and how many different initiatives the team can work on in
parallel. </p>
<p>Benefit #3: Encourage learning. The writings established the records for
future clinical examination and instituionalised proprietary learning.
When the final result is out, it'd be much easier to review and
hopefully learn from it by comparing the written records to what
actually happened.</p>
<p>Ok now the key pieces ...</p>
<p>Component #1: writing in narrative. Writing is more honest. It's harder
to hide half-thought-out arguments in clear, concise and coherent
writing.  According to Bezos: "When you have to write your ideas out in
complete sentences, complete paragraphs it forces a deeper clarity."
Andy Grove considered written reports vital because “the author is
forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.”</p>
<p>As for the story-telling narrative, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/386e57b2-52a9-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec">Bezos said</a> : "We
have so many metrics . . . and the thing I have noticed is that when the
anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.
There’s something wrong with the way you’re measuring." He believes in
telling a story vividly, rather than relying on data or graphics. (Have
you read of his <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm">handstand
story</a>
in his letter to shareholder?)</p>
<p>Component #2: six page limit. Precision counts. It requires a lot of
work for the team to deeply understand their own space, gather the data,
understand the operating tenets and be able to communicate all these
clearly. The Amazon team member often rewrite the memo several times to
make the writing "interesting and easy to read" before presenting to the
senior team. </p>
<p>As for the data, the validation, the information that feeds into the
narrative that doesn't carry the structure, they go into the appendixes
for completeness and cross reference.</p>
<p>Component #3: silent reading session. This is the weirdest meeting I'd
imagine. When asked "Why don't you read the memos in advance?" Bezos
replied "Time doesn't come from nowhere.  This way you know everyone has
the time. The author gets the nice warm feeling of seeing their hard
work being read." </p>
<p>Here is a recommendation on how to structure a six-pager. FWIW, it's a
reasonable starting point that I'd try to base my 2019 annual plans on.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the past it was like this …</li>
<li>Then something happened …</li>
<li>So now we should do this …</li>
<li>So the future might be like this …</li>

        <p>Property investor believes in the average numbers and she seeks above
average opportunities. Value investor believes in 80/20 rule and she
looks for outliers.  </p>
<p>Property investor focuses on the middle part of the bell curve. Value
investor spends her time at the tail end.</p>
<p>Property investor expects a moderate return on her investment. Value
investor bets on 10x returns from her money.</p>
<p>Property investor is right most of the time. Value investor is wrong
seven or eight times out of ten.</p>
<p>Property investor looks elsewhere for references to set her price. Value
investor looks into spreadsheets for models and assumptions. </p>
<p>Property investor likes a good story. Value investor likes a good story
too, but she loves a great financial model even better.</p>
<p>Property investor's main contribution is her capital. Value investor's
contribution is her thoughts, perspectives and unique understanding of a
demographic, a market or a technology. Capital is a ticket for her to
get involved.</p>
<p>There are many more property investors than value investors.  Like many
things in life, there is no right or wrong to each approach.  But as an
early stage entreprenuer, it is critical that we develop the
intellectual muscle to quickly figure out what makes the other person
tick. </p>

        <p>B2C and B2B are two different kinds of businesses and they call for very
different CEOs.</p>
<p>CEOs all need to set the vision, build a team and raise the funding.</p>
<p>But there is something fundamentally different here.</p>
<p>The B2B CEOs sell. Many of them went up the ladder through the sales
track. They are great salespeople and quite often they can be quite
effective task managers that <em>drives</em> the sales pipelines.  Think
Salesforce. Or Linkedin. Both produced awful software products but no
one can argue against their market share or valuations.</p>
<p>The B2C CEOs, however, are product designers by heart. They are very
<em>sensitive</em> to the product and they are obsessed with getting the user
experiences right.  Quite often they have a background in engineering. 
Having worked with a couple over the years, I can testify that they are
every bit awkward and introvert just like a typical engineer. Want some
examples? Ev Williams (Twitter), Steve Chen (my boss, YouTube and
Paypal) or Reed Hastings (Netflix, Pure software) are great examples
here.</p>
<p>Of course, the best CEO excel in both. Like Steve Jobs.</p>

        <p>This Christmas, I set a <strong>goal of writing one blog post every day in 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>I want to use writing to improve learning. Running a business means that
I always have something that's more "urgent" or "important". Learning
has been pushed down the list under the "nice but can wait till later"
category. I want to do better in 2019.</p>
<p>I also want to improve my communication skill. I've been mostly working
solo in the last three years. Now that I've built a team around myself,
communication becomes more important than getting things done by myself.
I'm hoping to use writing to solidify my thinking as well as documenting
the stories while they are still fresh and raw. </p>
<p>Lastly, I feel I do have something to share with the world. My story is
hardly unique, but I hope that someone somewhere will find these posts
helpful, encouraging, or even inspirational.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>PS. On the tactical side, I just replaced the old Jekyll site with this
Pelican installation. </p>
<p>Jekyll seems to be going strong with GitHub's support. I just couldn't
make it work again. I was on Ruby 1.9 and now the latest is 2.5.
Packages become obsolete. <code>gem update</code> broke. </p>
<p>Since I know Python better, it makes sense for me to migrate to a python
based site generator and hopefully maintaining the site will be better
in the long run.</p>
<p>I've also stripped the website to its bare bone. It's just a bunch of
markdown files with a minimum css. Creating a new post is as simple as 
creating a new <code>.md</code> file and publishing it is <code>make rsync_upload</code>.</p>

          Published: Sat 13 August 2016
        </abbr>
        <p>The moment the ultrasound image showed up on the screen, both of us knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>We went into to meet our second baby for the first time but instead we saw a uterus full of grape-shaped, watery tumors.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the pregnancy has gone wrong from the very beginning. Key DNA pieces were missing in the fertilised egg, which triggered a disease called molar pregnancy that grows fast. So quick that it’s considered a “pre-cancer condition” that needs to be taken care of immediately.</p>
<p>Thank the great public health system in New Zealand. Within 36 hours, the whole uterus was evacuated clean, and life went back to “normal” again.</p>
<p>It’s normal regarding the day-to-day operation. The outside. Deep inside, the long wait only just started.</p>
<p>In front of us, the best case scenario is that the hCG level keeps on dropping at a nice steady rate until it gets to a single digit, right from the peak value of 114,000, then we’ll wait another 6-12 months before we can try to have a baby again.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that there are 15-20% chance that Zephyr will need further chemotherapy and 2% chance for this disease to become a full-on Choriocarcinoma. Even here, we are still pretty luck because this type of cancer responds very well to chemotherapy. What it does mean though is the likelihood of having another baby will be low.</p>
<p>So, things have been pretty shitty for our little family in the last a few weeks. Whenever I found myself in this situation, I will try to see what life is trying to teach me. And here are three things I’ve found:</p>
<p>First, I feel incredibly lucky and profoundly grateful towards this country and the doctors, surgeons, nurses and midwives who have helped us. It took less than 48 hours from receiving the diagnosis result to a successful operation, and Zephyr discharged from the hospital. The whole process was swift, professional and even the brutal reality was delivered in the kindest way.</p>
<p>Second, I’ve never felt so connected with the people and the community around us. That big slab of ice in my heart was slowly melted away by the warm supports we received from our friends and the people around us. Everyone, we shared the news with would give us a big hug and told us their experiences. One of the ladies had eight miscarriages before she finally had two beautiful babies. The other had a baby that was almost full-term before the little heart stopped beating. These sad stories put our experience into perspective and pulled me out of those dark, sad and lonely places.</p>
<p>Last, the very possibility of having Mia as our only child helped to bring much-needed clarity to day-to-day activities. For example, we just had a few pretty decent falls of snow, and my usual intuition had been “meh, we’ll have another one soon so let me just focus on this feature now”. This time around, I didn’t even think about work before I spent most of Monday with Zephyr and Mia so we could have all the pristine snow to ourselves. I knew very well that there would never be another 2-year-old Mia happily playing snow with daddy. Next year, she will be 3.</p>
<p>To finish off here is a short quote from that captures what I wanted to say.</p>
<p _="%" endblockquote>{% blockquote Joybell.C https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4114218 %}
"Pain is a pesky part of being human, I've learned it feels like a stab wound to the heart, something I wish we could all do without, in our lives here. Pain is a sudden hurt that can't be escaped. But then I have also learned that because of pain, I can feel the beauty, tenderness, and freedom of healing. Pain feels like a fast stab wound to the heart. But then healing feels like the wind against your face when you are spreading your wings and flying through the air! We may not have wings growing out of our backs, but healing is the closest thing that will give us that wind against our faces."</p>

<p>Here is a simple framework that I use to make sure I am not fooling myself. When I need to make a major decision, I ask myself three questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is my gut feeling? </li>
<li>Let's build a model. What are the choices? What are the evaluation criteria? I'd make a spreadsheet of these and assigned a value from 1-10 to each cell, which will give me a score for each choice.</li>
<li>What does people I trust say? I will go to someone that I trust, someone will tell me his or her opinion without feeling uncomfortable. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, in the process of working through the above questions, the scores will gradually converge and the answer becomes clear. Like I said, this is pretty simple technique but it has served me well. </p>

        <p>A lot have happened between my last post in Apr, 2014 and now. Our daughter Mia was born in May and I started to work on a new startup <a href="http://happymoose.nz">happymoose.nz</a> from August. Bootstraping a new baby and a company at the same time haven't been too cruisy. (Although honestly I've taken a easier job because Zephyr has done a lot to shield me from the waking up three times during the night business. )</p>
<p>So I am back at blogging again. The main driver is that I realised quite often I failed to provide a succinct and quick answer to many questions. I almost always have too many things I want to say and didn't know where to start. I'm hoping that writing will give me more chances to practice.</p>
<p>Another reason is that since Mia was born, time starts to get blurred into a continuous stream of work, cooking, baby and slep. (not always in that nice sequential order though). I lost track of interesting or important things in life. I'd like to use writing as a way to help myself to savor what has happened on that date. </p>
<p>I'll try to write one post every day and I'll keep it raw and unpolished. The world won't grind to a halt if I make a mistake in grammar or spelling. If what I write interests you, great. If not, no drama because this time, I write for myself. </p>

        <h2>- fun</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwai_Point">Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter</a> is one of the 
largest industrial facilities in New Zealand.
Between 2008 and 2013, aluminium prices fell by more than 30 percent. The owner, Rio Tinto, has 
threatened to close the Tiwai Point smelter if it can't get a cheaper deal for electricity 
from retailer Meridian, or the Government fails to give it a substantial subsidy. 
The Smelter consumes about 15% of all electricities NZ generates. So there have been lots of 
discussions of what NZ should do if Rio Tinto does shut it down.</p>
<p>Here is a crazy idea. How about build a large a Bitcoin mining farm to use the electricity?<br>
This started as a <a href="https://twitter.com/farmgeek/status/406637109521305601">joke</a> on 
Twitter but after thinking about it for a while, it actually makes good sense. </p>
<p>Let's start with the technical side of the bitcoin mining business first. </p>
<p>You can think of the Bitcoin system as a global ledger and each transaciton 
as a switch from asset to liability in this ledger.  The Bitcoin miners play the roles of 
the central banks except that there are <a href="http://millybitcoin.com/how-many-people-are-bitcoin-mining/">thousands</a> 
of these "central banks" out there competing to perform the "clearing house" 
function for every transaction that happens in the Bitcoin universe. </p>
<p>The task of these clearing houses is very simple: they group a set of transactions together into a block,<br>
perform some checks and then put a stamp on it. The key step here is to "perform some check". 
This involves guessing a random number in, say, a trillion possibilities. There is no smart here. 
It's only about how fast you can brutal-force through all the possibilities and 
how cheap you can do this. </p>
<p>Of all those thousands participants, only the fastest one 
will win the transaction. All the rest, despite the fact that they might be half
way through, will simply throw away the existing work and start again. </p>
<p>Here, the speed is determined by two factors: pure luck and the speed of the guess. 
The luck is mathmatically gauranteed to be equal, or, more accurately, random. 
Even with the fastest computer, you might still lose to a tiny computer in one's garage.
You might think that this is a terribly competitive game to get yourself into. 
But it is a fierce competition only in the sense that it's a game of lottery
where only thousand of people buys and there are hundreds of chances to win
everyday. </p>
<p>So the real factor you can control is how fast you can guess. 
Once you've invested in the hardware, the main running cost is
the electricity bill, which Tiwai Point seems to have plenty of.</p>
<p>It's a common mistake to think that as we getting closer to the hard limit of 
<a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/161/how-many-bitcoins-will-there-eventually-be">21-million Bitcoins</a>, 
there will be no money left to be made for the miners.  Since a Bitcoin transaction won't 
succeed until it's processed by a miner. People who want 
a faster transaction, instead of waiting 7 hours, will usually offer a transaction fee.
According to the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees">Bitcoin website</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is envisioned that over time the cumulative effect of collecting transaction fees 
will allow somebody creating new blocks to "earn" more bitcoins than will be mined 
from new bitcoins created by the new block itself. This is also an incentive to keep 
trying to create new blocks even if the value of the newly created block from 
the mining activity is zero in the far future.</p>
