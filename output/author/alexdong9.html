        <h2>- design</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/about.mefi">Matt Haughey's talk on MetaFilter</a>, he has one slide that says "<em>Beautiful visual design doesn't always win</em>".   The story was that he paid someone to "redesign" the site. When the design is ready, he ran a test to send 50% anonymous user to the new design and 50% to the original site. It turned out that <strong>the old, "ugly" site outperformed the new design by 30%</strong>. (Fast forward to 9:30 if you're in a hurry.  I strongly recommend the whole video, it's not only entertaining but also provides quite different thinking into building a community site.)</p>
<p>In the age of iPhone and maybe a bit overuse of the word "beautiful", this kind of thinking sounds like heresy. But if you take a look at the popular community sites like HackerNews, SlashDot or Craigslist, you'll find that they are all not-so-pretty.  I'm sure they are not short of resources to get a "better" design but they choose not to, why is that? I come up with 3 explanations.  Please leave a comment to share your thoughts.</p>
<p>First, the more beautiful a site is, the less relaxed the user will be.  Hence less likely to participate. Community site is optimized around the goal of having people to hang around and talk to each other. Kind of like a party. Imagine you're invited to a party where there are a few Claude Monet paintings on the wall.  The ground is soft. The lights are adjusted to highlight the paintings. Will you spend more time chatting or will you feel guilty if your chit-chat breaks the mood that the paintings have created?  I suspect the same human feeling applies to online communities. If you want the users to feel relaxed and casual, you might have to make the site less logical, with less visual hierarchy.</p>
<p>Second, a distinguishable site makes it much easier to form a sense of belongingness. Or a sense of being part of something unique.   Seth Godin has a whole book to say about tribes. But the basic idea is <em>human beings can't help it: we need to belong. One of the most powerful of our survival mechanisms is to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of like-minded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging</em>.  Those distinguishable sites define their own social rules. And these rules are translated into look-and-feels by the creators. So from this perspective, the HackerNews orange or the reddit moscot is similar to the feathers to American Indians.</p>
<p>Last but not least, these community sites are actually very functional.  Prioritizing visual design over functional or interaction design is a common trap that many designers fall into. Community site is all about the contents and discussions. These site designs serve this goal very well.  I have yet seen anyone who comes to reddit or HackerNews and couldn't figure out what to do next. Yes, comment threads can be long but it is almost stupidly easy to add one. And that is what truly drives traffic and bump average time-on-site.</p>
<p>Having said this, I think an utility like Facebook, iPhone or Mail.app should adopt a more streamline and strong visual language.  When people derive values by performing certain tasks, a stronger visual design would help to guide, or force, the user to go down certain pre-defined path/funnel.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>On July. 26th, 2012, NYTimes announced that it's now "<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/07/new-york-times-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers.html">supported by readers, not advertisers</a>". This is a <strong>watershed moment in the history of internet</strong>.  As digital content becomes more and more native in our daily life, people are willing to pay for good contents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the company's big three papers — the <em>Times</em>, <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, and Boston_ Globe_ — print and digital ad dollars dipped 6.6 percent to $220 million, while circulation revenue was up 8.3 percent to $233 million. <strong>The historical rebalancing</strong>, which occurred at the News Media Group for the first time in Q1, <strong>may indicate a sea change in an industry that has long relied on advertising to stay afloat</strong>. "They're probably the first major paper that has crossed that line," media analyst Ken Doctor of <em>Newsonomics</em> told Daily Intel. "It is an interesting moment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost at the same time, quite a few major internet brands suffer from non-trivial market value evaporation. As written in <a href="http://www.dailydealmedia.com/789facebook-groupon-pandora-and-zynga-have-drained-almost-50-billion-from-investors/">Facebook, Groupon, Pandora and Zynga have Drained Almost $50 Billion from Investors</a>, the author wrote the following about Facebook's performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soaring from a ridiculously inflated IPO price of $38 tagging $45 before reality set in. After a fantastic earnings report (sarcasm here) shares are trading today at $23.49 down only $ .22 on the day (.91%). That, my friend, is a loss of $34.4 billion in market capitalization or 38.2%. Tally so far – $ 34.4 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am amused by this stark comparison.  I still believe that Facebook is creating good amount of value, but whether that justifies such a high stock price is probably a different story.  I found the following analysis echoing with my past experience.  It basic posts a good question: <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/3024">what if social networks value diminishes as the platform starts to monetize it? </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every community-based site in the history of the web has essentially been a stab at creating a social network. Most of them fail as businesses, with the rare exception of small, lucky communities that become self-sufficient but not exactly prosperous. What if that’s just the way it is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you prefer tables, numbers and a little bit fundamental analysis, this article has laid the most solid, and technical, analysis of the "<a href="http://www.econmatters.com/2012/05/whats-fair-value-for-facebook-stock.html">real value of facebook</a>".   Based on the size of the advertisement market is "2.1% to 2.3% of nominal GDP" and the numbers disclosed by facebook, the author puts out the following table on projections in 2016.  We'll see.</p>

<p>The new basecamp has a very <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3170-new-in-the-all-new-basecamp-email-in">nicely designed instructions</a> for adding discussions and todo lists via email.  For anyone who has tried to design a feature like this, it's always a challenge to describe the multiple steps and make it easy to remember.  There are two things from this design that really stand out.</p>
<p>First is It describes the action items in a clear numbered-list. Use links and bolded fonts to highlight the important points. <img alt="" src="http://37assets.s3.amazonaws.com/svn/bcxemailin/todolist.png"></p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>Many people in the valley would say "Startup is for opportunists". <a href="http://influencehacks.com/the-value-of-short-term-thinking">This one</a> explains why. Please read this one with a grain of salt since I think the scope for this one is mainly for technology startups that are built to take advantage of a new enabling technology. But still, it's good to see the point from the other side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In technology, long term thinking is impossible, because everything changes so fast, and the pace of change is quickening. The rules are changing too fast. Nobody knows when a sudden shift in technology will open up new markets and business models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All we can do as entrepreneurs is take it step by step, and adapt quickly when we sense the market shifting.</p>
<p>To set the scope a bit, I do think the team, the industry and the understanding of the target market shouldn't change over time.  The knowledge of why people pay for the service should stay the same.  The connections wouldn't change that much.</p>

        <h2>- startup</h2>
<p>"Release early" is probably one of the most important things that every startup should remember.  As a serial entrepreneur, I have inevitably pitched this idea many times. So you can imagine how surprised and disappointed I was when I was asked "why it took so long to release?".   I have fallen into this classic trap of startup. I keep on iterating the product without releasing it to the wild.</p>
<p>In the <em>Odyssey,</em> the Sirens sing a song so irresistible that none can hear it and escape. Circe warns Odysseus of the danger and tells him how to avoid it. He must plug up his mens' ears with beeswax, and have himself tied to the mast, if he wishes to hear it.</p>
<p>I spent the last month thinking about how to stop myself making this mistake again. The conclusion turns out to be surprisingly simple. <strong>Treat "release early" as a religion</strong>.  All the reasons that put off release could have reasonable arguments.  They would make perfect sense when you think of them as stand-alone problems.  But at the end of the day,  no matter how valid the points are, faced with the "irresistible tendency", we should probably follow Circe's advice and treat release early as an unbreakable belief.</p>
<p>My frist mistake is also the most common one: "one shot mentality".  I over-estimated the importance of the first shot. I worry that if we deliver an inferior product, if we get the color wrong, or the text not lined up properly, or the warning dialog box doesn't have the proper drop-shadow, people will remember these for the rest of their life.  You may find this laughable. You may ask who would be so stupid to waste time on these trivial things. Well, the world is full of people who are fanscinated by the <a href="https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/gcSStkKxXTw">icon ambulance story</a> or <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/programming-and-development/avoid-getting-buried-in-technical-debt/3849">don't accumulate technical debt</a>.  As we sink deeper and deeper into the product, it's almost impossible to refrain ourselves from worrying about those details. Except maybe having a mast we can tie ourselves to.</p>
<p>With a deadline, it becomes a lot easier to decide which one is more important. Shall we support a close integration with facebook or implement an internal tool to track bugs because frankly no bug tracking system on this planet gets it right yet.  A deadline also acts as a "<a href="http://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html">shakedown cruise</a> ". If anything major is broken like the founders hate each other, or the engineers want to stab the designers from the back or the idea is fundamentally wrong, the stress imposed by the deadline will help to shake these problems out.</p>
<p>However, an artificial deadline is, well, artificial. Everyone knows it's just some date that the CEO grabs from thin air.  There is always a tension to push off the deadline a bit more. "One week, we just need one more week."   Unfortunately the longer the team works on the problem, the more they understand it and the more problems they can see. If the team starts to dogfood their own product, someone somewhere will always find some fundamental flaw in the product that needs to be addressed before the product can be released, like <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-2-support-ie6-ie7-ie8/">IE8 support</a>.</p>
<p>The real danger here is who the product is designed for. The longer the product stays in the hands of engineers, the further it is steered away from the real user who might be using it.  PG once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won't know your users. <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a> now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have no idea. No web startup does. And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. Better to release something and let them tell you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things could be even worse if the developer is solving his own problems.  For every improvement he does, he might alienate 100 other users who would otherwise use the service.  It's almost like we have to keep reminding ourselves that some random person on the internet knows better.  If we could put our ego aside and stay humble, this is exactly what "release often" and "iterate" mean. To listen to what your users ask for and build it for them.</p>
<p>When a deadline is not sufficient, the startup team needs to have some external expectation. For example line up some journalists and release the news of product launch date to the wild.  Or making the CEO the champion of external world in the team.  If he has announced the release date to content partners, channel partners, potential users or investors, he will feel personally obligated to meet the date. Hence making it much harder to extend the deadline.</p>
