<p>Fred Wilson just posted an interesting paper on startup business models for Bitcoin Bank. Â I bolded 3 fundamental questions that each startup should try to answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you are finalising your Business Model Canvas for your final project for this course, think about <strong>what your key value proposition is and who is your primary customer</strong> and focus on that. And think about what you can do in your <strong>revenue model to make it</strong> so that it will be h<strong>ard for others to come in and undercut you</strong>. And think about your <strong>cost model and how to keep it as low as possible while allowing your company to be best in class</strong> at what it does.</p>
