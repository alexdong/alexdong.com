      <p>Another day. Another tweetstorm. This time by
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936">@naval</a>:</p>
<p>Just like yesterday, I'm handcopying the full thread here as a way to
appreciate and understand it better. </p>
<p>Key concepts: specific knowledge (proprietary knowledge is what I prefer
to call it), leverage, accountability, and judgement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn
   while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is
   your place in the social hierarchy.</li>
<li>Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly
   despise wealth, it will elude you.</li>
<li>Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking
   people playing wealth creation games.</li>
<li>You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own
   equity --- a piece of a business --- to gain your financial freedom.</li>
<li>You'll get rich by <a href="/platform-wins-by-turning-everyone-into-commodity-sellers.html">giving society what it wants but does not yet know
   how to get. At scale.</a> </li>
<li>Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term
   people.</li>
<li>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.
   Most people haven't figured this out yet.</li>
<li>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth,
   relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</li>
<li>Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above
   all, integrity.</li>
<li>Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are
    self-fulfilling.</li>
<li>Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be
    unstoppable.</li>
<li>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and
    <a href="/hello-2019.html">leverage</a></li>
<li>Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If
    society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.</li>
<li>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and
    passion rather than whatever is hot right now.</li>
<li>Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look
    like work to others.</li>
<li>When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not
    schools.</li>
<li>Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot
    be outsourced or automated.</li>
<li>Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.
    Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.</li>
<li>The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands:
    Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. (AD: Trump? Really?)</li>
<li>"Give me a leverl long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move
    the earth." - Archimedes.</li>
<li>Fortune require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital,
    people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and
    media).</li>
<li>Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge,
    with accountability, and show resulting good judgement.</li>
<li>Labour means people working for you. It's the oldest and most
    fought-over form of leverage. Labour leverage will impress your
    parents, but don't waste your life chasing it.</li>
<li>Capital and labour are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing
    capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to
    lead, but someone has to follow you.</li>
<li>Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage
    behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works
    for you while you sleep.</li>
<li>An army of robots is freely available --- it's just packed in data
    centres for heat and space efficiency. Use it.</li>
<li>If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and
    podcasts. </li>
<li>Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.</li>
<li>Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning
    foundational skills.</li>
<li>There is no skill called "business". Avoid business magazines and
    business classes.</li>
<li>Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics,
    mathematics, and computers.</li>
<li>Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
    (AD: what the hell does this mean? Spend less time socialising and
    more time reading? Just do it mentality?)</li>
<li>You should be too busy to "do coffee", while still keeping an
    uncluttered calendar. </li>
<li>Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a
    problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If
    outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource
    it.</li>
<li>Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you
    work on are more important than how hard you work. </li>
<li>Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep refining what you
    do until this is true.</li>
<li>There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else
    getting rich off you. </li>
<li>Apply specific knowledge, with leverage and good judgement, and
    eventually you will get what you deserve. </li>
<li>When you're finally wealthy, you'll realise that it wasn't what you
    were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day. (AD:
    This is pretty fruastrating way to end a thoughtful thread. )</li>
