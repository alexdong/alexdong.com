      <h2>- code</h2>
<p>For the last two weeks, I've been working on an audit project for an Android app. 
I worked on Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE">WinCE</a> about 14 years ago. 
I am quietly impressed by how developer friendly the Android platform is. Here are a couple of
shell scripts I have written to make the reverse engineering process easier. </p>
<p>During our work, it is quite common to make some modification to the smali files 
generated by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/">apktool</a>, turn it back 
into a proper apk and install on the device to see whether our guesses were correct. 
This is quite a repetitive process that involves sign the apk, align the zip file, 
uninstall the original app and install the new one from local computer to the device. </p>
<p><code>Pack.sh</code> is a shell script that automates this process for you. It takes two parameters, 
the first is the folder where the smali files are; the second is the package name 
for the application, which is needed for us to automatically uninstalled the app from 
the device. </p>
<p>{% gist 6073781 %}</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a> is a brilliant tool that allows you to 
attach to a running process and see all the unix system calls it's making. 
Once you get it up and running, it is almost trivial to get a comprehensive view 
of the app's interaction with Android system, for example, 
which files it touches, which urls it requests. </p>
<p>In our case, the app would be launched and crashed immediately, leaving us no time
to manually attach a strace to the process to see what has gone wrong. <code>ambush.sh</code>
is a shell script that waits for a process to show up and automatically attach strace
to that process. This makes it possible for us to see what the app has been doing 
before it crashes itself. It takes two parameters too. The first is the pattern 
that <code>ps | grep</code> could use to find the process id; the latter is where the strace
is located. </p>
<p>{% gist 6034934 %}</p>
<p><a href="http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/18/android-runtime-strace">Benno</a>
has compiled a version of <a href="http://benno.id.au/android/strace">strace for Android</a>.
If you have <a href="www.busybox.net">busybox</a> installed, you can run the following command 
to install it from the net. </p>
<p _="%" endcodeblock>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
    $ cd /data/local
    $ wget http://benno.id.au/android/strace
    $ chmod 555 ./strace</p>
<p>Please note that you'll have to put the strace in <code>/data/local</code> in order to 
use <code>chmod</code> to make it an executable. </p>
