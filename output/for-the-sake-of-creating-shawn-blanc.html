<blockquote>
<p>when it comes to creative work, finances measure only one definition of success. Is there such a thing as a successful designer who makes a below-average wage? Or can a writer who makes no money at all still be successful? Of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is another definition of success: sustained pride in the quality of our work.</p>
<p>If, in our creative endeavors, we continually do work we are proud of, then that my friends is also success. We don’t make to get rich, we make to make. We build for the sake of building, create for the sake of creating.</p>
