Come
From?</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first estimate, from Adrian Zenz, a social scientist at the
European School of Culture &amp; Theology, is based on an accounting of
the detention camp populations totalling some 892,000 individuals in
68 Xinjiang counties as of the Spring of 2018. </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>The second estimate comes from the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit
Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD). Between mid-2017 and mid-2018,
CHRD interviewed eight ethnic Uighurs located in eight different
villages in southern Xinjiang. Each person gave their own estimate of
the number of people detained in their village, which CHRD used to
surmise a detention rate for each village. These village detention
rates ranged from 8 to 20 percent, averaging out to 12.8 percent
across all eight villages. Just as Zenz did, CHRD “conservatively”
rounded down to reach a 10 percent estimated detention rate.</p>

Bureaucracy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do countries with a long history of state-building fare better in the
long run? Recent work has shown that earlier state-building may lead
to higher levels of present-day growth. By contrast, I use a natural
experiment to show that the regions of China with over a thousand
years of sustained exposure to state-building are significantly poorer
today. The mechanism of persistence, I argue, was the introduction of
a civil service exam based on knowledge of Confucian classics, which
strengthened the social prestige of the civil service and weakened the
prestige of commerce. A thousand years later, the regions of China
where the Confucian bureaucracy was first introduced have a more
educated population and more Confucian temples, but lower levels of
wealth. The paper contributes to an important debate on the Great
Divergence, highlighting how political institutions interact with
culture to cause long-run patterns of growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a neat article with some interesting data points. I love to
believe in the conclusion but I think the author has the cause and
effect sequence wrong. </p>
<p>I think the poorer parts of China tend to be flatter, share common
langauge, thus easier to rule through a central state. But because of
their location, they are too far away from the coast to benefit from
international trades. The wealthier parts tend to have poor
transportation system, more cut-off from the central state and, without
a better choice, had to rely more on trade, thus enjoying the fruits
from doing so.</p>

data</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>shipments dropped 15.5 percent to roughly 390 million units for the
year, with a 17 percent slump in December.</p>
<p>The Chinese smartphone market, the world’s largest, could shrink
another 3 percent this year, Canalys said, in what would be a third
straight year of declines. Smartphone shipments in the country had
fallen 4 percent in 2017.</p>
