        <h2>- bestof</h2>
<p>People ask me "why do you build <a href="http://choir.io">choir.io</a>". Yes,
the <a href="http://choir.io/player/f9c750f2bedb0c0f">Github Realtime Activity</a> 
demo is cool, but are you really going to bet your next startup on this?" </p>
<p>My answer is yes and this post explains why. </p>
<p>Five years from now, most of us will handle
casual computing tasks with wearable computers.  We don't know what 
the devices might look like but it's almost certain that we will be 
communicating with them using voice commands.  Google Moto X's 
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522054/moto-x-always-listening-voice-commands-new-notifications">"always listening"</a>
feature enables us to talk to the phone without having to launch an 
app. Google's voice search is finally fast enough to keep up with 
my natural speaking speed. </p>
<p>However, the options for computers to communicate back to us 
are still very limited. Your email client might play a ding sound
when a new email arrives. But the sound stays the same regardless of whom 
the mail is sent from and how important it is to you.  </p>
<p>Our ears are born multi-tasking masters. As I am
typing this, I could hear the heat pump's humming, 
the wind blowing the leaves and the light tapping of snow flakes on the 
window.  All at the same time. </p>
<p>We can also, almost effortlessly, notice changes of a sound among 
different background "noises".  Without looking out of the window, I can tell 
that the snow has just turned into a sleety rain, because the soft snow
falling sound has become much louder as the ice hitting the ground. </p>
<p>Sound is the perfect medium for wearable computers to talk back to us. 
Sound has a dozen of properties that we can tune to convey different 
level of emotions and intrusiveness.  Different sound packs would fit 
into various contexts. </p>
<p>This is where Choir comes in. Choir provides a programmable
interface to translate events into a rich set of context-aware sounds.
Our users mark events with emotions and intrusivenss and we take care of the
rest. </p>
<p>Is Choir too early for the market? Certainly not. Choir has three 
killer applications. </p>
<p>First, ambient sound monitoring. By associating user or server 
activities with different sounds, you can stay aware of the current statuses
without having to look at the graphs. If something unusual happens, you would
hear the changes almost subconsciously.  Failed login requests, rejected 
credit card transactions, 500 errors are a few good examples here. </p>
<p>Second, notify without interruptions. Today your notifications are 
mostly delivered via email or chat room messages. You have to bear the cost
of context switches to checkout these messages.  Choir can provide you 
with a more fine-grained control over different type of notifications. 
For example, you might choose to play a pleasant, low-intrusive sound
when a user gives a kudos to a support ticket, but you would probably want to
select a negative and intrusive sound, maybe a sea monster roar, if a 
user just unsubscribed from your service. If you hear too many of the 
scary sea monster noises, you will know something is wrong. </p>
<p>Third, celebrate with others.  Some companies would hit a giant
gone when they close a new deal. It is a great morale booster to bring 
the whole team together and share the excitement of successes. 
Now you could configure Choir to play a cheerful sound when a new paid
user sign up for your service. </p>
<p>If you are interested to give Choir a go, please request an invite at 
<a href="http://choir.io">http://choir.io</a>. You can also visit our <a href="http://choir.uservoice.com">support
forum</a> and tell us what you think. 
We'd love to hear from you. </p>

<p>I did not premeditate anything. I just winged it, and when I saw problems I triaged them. The Slashdot system was very much evolved and not designed.   One thing I learned is don’t spend your entire life playing predictive defense against attacks that will never happen. Real people are very clever. If they choose to attack you they’ll attack you in ways you can’t predict.
Most people are just purely passive consumers, and that’s okay. I think a lot of people in this space obsess too much over trying to convert passives into actives. Some people are just wired to be that kind of person. Others aren’t. That’s okay.
With more and more voices, you tend toward broader subjects. Eventually it becomes less and less interesting. But what’s interesting to [me] isn’t always the thing that’s most lucrative. I had a pretty strong belief that the population of Slashdot users was relatively fixed. That makes for a crappy business model. You want to have a million really good users and be done?

Similarly, U.S.-based online photo printing has become a big deal, growing by about 20% annually between 2007-2012 according to market research firm IbisWorld. Three significant reasons for this growth are: the adoption of digital cameras, ability to transport photos online, and the increase in broadband and mobile Internet connections.

<li>Asm.js competes very well on mobile performance compared to Dalvik. Even throwing out the benchmarks that are highly favourable to asm.js (binary-trees and fasta), there seems to be a consistent 10-50% speedup over comparable Dalvik code.</li>

<p>Recently I came across a suggestion on <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/8300/ideas-for-daily-exercises-to-improve-photography-technique">ideas for daily excercises to improve
photography technique</a>. 
Here are the main ideas from "art school's true exercises": </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Take n pictures of a single object, making sure that no two were the same (n was generally some large number like '100' or '250') - 
   The exercise was designed to train yourself to begin to see the many ways it's possible to approach a subject...</li>
<li>Find an object and take the exact same picture of it every hour for 24 hours (generally an inanimate object... ) - 
   The goal was to see how even something that doesn't move changes quite radically depending on what is going on around it.</li>
<li>Take 100 pictures of objects that have a common characteristic (they're all buildings, they're all less than 1 inch wide, 
   they're all blue, etc.) - The goal was to learn how to find interesting pictures 'hiding inside' everyday objects.</li>
<li>Take 100 pictures from a perspective you wouldn't normally think to take pictures from (lying down, under water, 
   upside down, cropped to 1x6, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think these four steps could be mapped to the similar process in learning and mastering the art of programming, ie 
learning your tool, understand the context, form your own opinion and open up to new ideas. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of movies, near the end of the hit film "Catch Me If You Can," there's a scene that Snowden might do well to watch while he's killing time in the airport lounge (or wherever he is) pondering his fate. The young forger, Frank Abagnale, who has been staying a step ahead of the feds, finally grows irritated and fatigued. Not because they are particularly skilled in their hunting, nor because they are getting closer, but simply because they won't give up. In a fit of pique, he blurts into the phone, "Stop chasing me!" On the other end, the dogged, bureaucratic Treasury agent, Carl Hanratty, answers, "I can't stop. It's my job."
Ultimately, this is why many people who have been involved in such matters believe Snowden will be caught.  ...
They'll have to make Edward Snowden their living, because those who are chasing him already have. Government agents will be paid every minute of every day for as long as it takes. Seasons may change and years may pass, but the odds say that one morning, he'll look out of a window, go for a walk or stop for a cup of coffee, and the trap will spring shut. It will be almost like a movie.</p>

        <h2>- code</h2>
<p>For the last two weeks, I've been working on an audit project for an Android app. 
I worked on Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE">WinCE</a> about 14 years ago. 
I am quietly impressed by how developer friendly the Android platform is. Here are a couple of
shell scripts I have written to make the reverse engineering process easier. </p>
<p>During our work, it is quite common to make some modification to the smali files 
generated by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/">apktool</a>, turn it back 
into a proper apk and install on the device to see whether our guesses were correct. 
This is quite a repetitive process that involves sign the apk, align the zip file, 
uninstall the original app and install the new one from local computer to the device. </p>
<p><code>Pack.sh</code> is a shell script that automates this process for you. It takes two parameters, 
the first is the folder where the smali files are; the second is the package name 
for the application, which is needed for us to automatically uninstalled the app from 
the device. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a> is a brilliant tool that allows you to 
attach to a running process and see all the unix system calls it's making. 
Once you get it up and running, it is almost trivial to get a comprehensive view 
of the app's interaction with Android system, for example, 
which files it touches, which urls it requests. </p>
<p>In our case, the app would be launched and crashed immediately, leaving us no time
to manually attach a strace to the process to see what has gone wrong. <code>ambush.sh</code>
is a shell script that waits for a process to show up and automatically attach strace
to that process. This makes it possible for us to see what the app has been doing 
before it crashes itself. It takes two parameters too. The first is the pattern 
that <code>ps | grep</code> could use to find the process id; the latter is where the strace
is located. </p>
<p>{% gist 6034934 %}</p>
<p><a href="http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/18/android-runtime-strace">Benno</a>
has compiled a version of <a href="http://benno.id.au/android/strace">strace for Android</a>.
If you have <a href="www.busybox.net">busybox</a> installed, you can run the following command 
to install it from the net. </p>
<p _="%" endcodeblock>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
    $ cd /data/local
    $ wget http://benno.id.au/android/strace
    $ chmod 555 ./strace</p>
<p>Please note that you'll have to put the strace in <code>/data/local</code> in order to 
use <code>chmod</code> to make it an executable. </p>
