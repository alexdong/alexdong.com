<p>Ran into a few posts about startup traction and the concept of quant based market. Thought it might benefit some readers of this blog. (If you haven't read my previous post of <a href="http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/">distribution channels,</a> you should.)</p>

<p>Gabriel from DuckDuckGo has two nice articles on this topic.  "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">How to move the needle</a>" talks about traction for different growth period and "<a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html">Traction mistakes</a>" lists 4 common mistakes people make. I have all four of them squarely.  This 50% time on product and 50% for traction parallel thinking is certainly the approach I'd take if I have a chance to do it again.   BTW, he is writing a <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">book</a> on this topic too. His co-author has a <a href="http://justinmares.com/thoughts-on-paul-grahams-growth/">recent review </a>on PG's "Startup = Growth" essay which echos what Gabriel has said.</p>

<p>Noah Kagan who did the original marketing work for mint.com has an interesting post on <a href="http://okdork.com/2010/07/15/quant-based-marketing-for-pre-launch-start-ups/">Quant Based Marketing</a>.  The basic idea is pretty simple. List all potential channels of incoming attention and conversion rate from day-0. Then follow through the list.  Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuTYwDzB4XSudGpFcE9lSWI4YzUwcnhKZnNoMktEdkE&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0">spreadsheet </a>for it. Worth a close look.</p>
