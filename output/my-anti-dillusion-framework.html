<p>Here is a simple framework that I use to make sure I am not fooling myself. When I need to make a major decision, I ask myself three questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is my gut feeling? </li>
<li>Let's build a model. What are the choices? What are the evaluation criteria? I'd make a spreadsheet of these and assigned a value from 1-10 to each cell, which will give me a score for each choice.</li>
<li>What does people I trust say? I will go to someone that I trust, someone will tell me his or her opinion without feeling uncomfortable. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, in the process of working through the above questions, the scores will gradually converge and the answer becomes clear. Like I said, this is pretty simple technique but it has served me well. </p>
