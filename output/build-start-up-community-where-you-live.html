<p>I am a firm believer that it is possible to build a startup community where you live.  Especially as the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">software is eating the world</a>, I see lots of opportunities when you merge local and mobile together.</p>
<p>Having said this, it won't be easy. There haven't been a clear break-out yet, although New York, Seattle, Boulder are clearly leading the game. I have been consulted on how to do that in our little town Dunedin. I've talked about local capital, proven records, good quality engineers. I have wanted to summarize it into a clearly organized todo list but luckily that has been done by a <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/">very capable VC</a>: <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/09/27/what-makes-a-successful-startup-community-is-it-possible-to-build-one-where-you-live/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BothSidesOfTheTable+%28Both+Sides+of+the+Table%29">What Makes a Successful Startup Community?
