Just like the previous two days, I'm handcopying a piece of writing today. 

This one is a letter from Steve Jobs. It's so tightly crafted that it's almost beautiful.  (Source: [Daring

>> Apple today announced that it expects to generate revenues of about
>> $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion in the June quarter, down from previous
>> guidance of about $1.6 billion. The lower-than-expected revenues are
>> primarily due to soft demand in the consumer and creative markets
>> such as advertising and publishing. Geographically, revenue shortfall
>> is expected to be offset significantly by higher-than-expected gross
>> margins primarily due to lower costs of some components. Accordingly,
>> the Company has revised its earnings guidance from $.08 to $.10 per
>> diluted share, compared to previous guidance of $.11 or slightly
>> higher.
>>
>> "Like others in our industry, we are experiencing a slowdown in sales
>> this quarter. As a result, we're going to miss our revenue
>> projections by around 10%, resulting in slightly lower profits," said
>> Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "We've got some amazing new products in
>> development, so we're excited about the year ahead. As one of the few
>> companies currently making a profit in the PC business, we remain
>> very optimistic about Apple's prospects for long-term growth".

Here is John Gruber's commentary on the writing.

> Look at the tight construction of that message from Apple in 2002.
> First paragraph: put out the numbers. Second paragraph: it’s an
> industry-wide problem, but Apple has “amazing new products” coming.
> And then the kicker, the dagger: “As one of the few companies
> currently making a profit in the PC business…”.
> 
> We’ve got some short term bad news but don’t worry, we have this.”
> And… out. Short and sweet. Rip off the bad news Band-Aid, express
> quiet confidence that Apple is in great shape, and that’s it. Message
> over.
