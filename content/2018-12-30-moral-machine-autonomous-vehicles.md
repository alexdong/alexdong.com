Numbers are clean and precise.  

Life is fuzzy and poetic. 

We should develop the muscle to appreciate both. After all, we are born
with a left brain for logic and a right brain for intuition.
Why should we only use one?  

Contrary to popular belief that numbers are cold and cruel. I think
numbers give us a sense of agency. Instead of feeling powerless and at
the mercy of a giant random number generator in the sky, a good model
with a few numbers will help us see the world clearer.  As an
individual, we'll know what to do with our energy and our limited life.

Here are a couple of cool examples. Each takes a thorny question with
substantial social and moral implications and comes up with an experiment to
put a definite number on them. I find the designs fascinating and the
numbers revealing some fascinating aspects of the human psyche. I hope you
enjoy them too. 

First. How much is Facebook worth to a user? Answer: $1000 per year.
Quoting from the [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101):

> Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global
> users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are
> hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three
> non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to
> deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the
> populations sampled and the auction design differ across the
> experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would
> require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While
> the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on
> the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these
> services provide for their users are large.

Second. Whose life worth more? An infant or a pregnant woman? A dog or a
a criminal?  Tough questions, huh?  Well, there is an
answer to that. Infant. And dog. 

Even more interesting is that this is also a global preference, which
means that it's the same across 233 countries and cultures. (Here

the graph. )

Quoting from the
[paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6) on Nature:

> With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns
> about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of
> quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that
> should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed
> the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore
> the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered
> 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233
> countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this
> experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we
> document individual variations in preferences, based on respondentsâ€™
> demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and
> uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these
> differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits.
> We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global,
> socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this
> article are publicly available.
