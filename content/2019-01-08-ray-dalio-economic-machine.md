I finally found time to sit down and watch Ray Dalio's famous 30 minutes [How The
Economic Machine Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)
video. It's totally different from the classic Econ 101 but it feels more
practical and seems to explain the world economy better and in a simpler
way. 

Things I learned:

* Credit/debt boosts growth first and depress it later. Credit
  encourages spending which boosts economy; however the need to pay back
  the debts reduced spending which depresses the economy. 
* Higher interest rate lowers the assets present value. Given the same
  future cash flow projection, higher interests rate means higher
  discounts, which means lower present value.
* Stock market goes down when economy and profit growth is strong. This
  is counter-intuitive but it's part of the natural cycle.
* Short-term cycle is 7-10 years and long-term cycle takes about 70-100
  years.
* Productivity matters in the long run. Credit matters in the short run.
* When the economy becomes deflationary because of the contraction from
  debt payment, printing money converts credits to money. So printing
  money is inflationary. It works because as long inflation is higher
  than deflation, the debt burden is taken care of. The key is to
  balance the inflation and deflation.
* The term "Lost decade" comes because of a long term readjustment takes
  10 years for the market to go back to where it was. Even when the
  deleveraging is handled perfectly, it will still take 3 years for
  going down and another 7 to go back to where it was. 
* Three advices: don’t let debt increase faster than income, otherwise
  the debt will crush you; don’t let income rises faster than
  productivity growth, otherwise you will become less competitive;
  always improve the productivity because it is what matters in the long
  run.
