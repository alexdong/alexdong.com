B2C and B2B are two different kinds of businesses and they call for very
different CEOs.

CEOs all need to set the vision, build a team and raise the funding.

But there is something fundamentally different here.

The B2B CEOs sell. Many of them went up the ladder through the sales
track. They are great salespeople and quite often they can be quite
effective task managers that *drives* the sales pipelines.  Think
Salesforce. Or Linkedin. Both produced awful software products but no
one can argue against their market share or valuations.

The B2C CEOs, however, are product designers by heart. They are very
*sensitive* to the product and they are obsessed with getting the user
experiences right.  Quite often they have a background in engineering. 
Having worked with a couple over the years, I can testify that they are
every bit awkward and introvert just like a typical engineer. Want some
examples? Ev Williams (Twitter), Steve Chen (my boss, YouTube and
Paypal) or Reed Hastings (Netflix, Pure software) are great examples
here.

Of course, the best CEO excel in both. Like Steve Jobs.
