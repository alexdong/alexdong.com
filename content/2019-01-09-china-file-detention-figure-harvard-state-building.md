[Where Did the One Million Figure for Detentions in Xinjiang’s Camps
Come
From?](http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/where-did-one-million-figure-detentions-xinjiangs-camps-come):

> The first estimate, from Adrian Zenz, a social scientist at the
> European School of Culture & Theology, is based on an accounting of
> the detention camp populations totalling some 892,000 individuals in
> 68 Xinjiang counties as of the Spring of 2018. 
>
> ...  
>
> The second estimate comes from the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit
> Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD). Between mid-2017 and mid-2018,
> CHRD interviewed eight ethnic Uighurs located in eight different
> villages in southern Xinjiang. Each person gave their own estimate of
> the number of people detained in their village, which CHRD used to
> surmise a detention rate for each village. These village detention
> rates ranged from 8 to 20 percent, averaging out to 12.8 percent
> across all eight villages. Just as Zenz did, CHRD “conservatively”
> rounded down to reach a 10 percent estimated detention rate.

[When State-Building Hinders Growth: The Legacy of China's Confucian
Bureaucracy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3292226):

This is a neat article with some interesting data points. I love to
believe in the conclusion but I think the author has the cause and
effect sequence wrong. 

I think the poorer parts of China tend to be flatter, share common
langauge, thus easier to rule through a central state. But because of
their location, they are too far away from the coast to benefit from
international trades. The wealthier parts tend to have poor
transportation system, more cut-off from the central state and, without
a better choice, had to rely more on trade, thus enjoying the fruits
from doing so.

[China smartphone shipments seen down 12-15.5 percent last year: market
data](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-smartphone-research/china-smartphone-shipments-seen-down-12-15-5-percent-last-year-market-data-idUSKCN1P20X2):

> shipments dropped 15.5 percent to roughly 390 million units for the
> year, with a 17 percent slump in December.

> The Chinese smartphone market, the world’s largest, could shrink
> another 3 percent this year, Canalys said, in what would be a third
> straight year of declines. Smartphone shipments in the country had
> fallen 4 percent in 2017.
