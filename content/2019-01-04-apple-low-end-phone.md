This full thread is from
[@stevesi](https://mobile.twitter.com/stevesi/status/1081174886901473280). 
Steven Sinofsky is one of the best strategic thinkers and this thread
talks about the topics I blogged [yesterday](/platform-wins-by-turning-everyone-into-commodity-sellers.html).

1. What's the typical way for a luxury brand to broaden its appearl. 
2. How does a platform make money?
3. How does players on a platform make their money? 
4. How has Apple avoided been bogged down by the partners?

(I'm re-typing everything again so I get to appreciate his points
better.  Steven, or twitter, owns his tweets. Not me. )

1. Apple has long known it is missing the boat on providing low priced
   phones --- strategic mistake to cede "low end" to Android. Or raised
   prices too much/soon. Then it must be an easy answer to just lower
   prices or make low priced phones. Ack! Harder than it looks.
2. Pricing is much more sophisticated than this. Pricing not only says
   who can afford your product but also establishes a brand, determines
   channel & more.  Many say Apple is a luxury brand; certainly they
   focused on that.
3. PC v Mac really showed the weakness in appealing to luxury brand in a
   volume driven market. High prices were the undoing of the Mac  from
   the very early days. 
   Going back to 1990, height of Apple, PCs sold at 10X the Mac run
   rate. But Macs had much higher margins per device.
4. While available software was a big part of that 10X, reality was that
   a Mac computer also cost substantially more than a PC, and depending
   on configuration was often 2X the price.
   Everyone knew. Apple/Jobs refused to license Mac System enabling
   cheaper Macs (one approach).
5. PC strategy was low everyday prices for PCs. BUT there was a catch or
   three --- really important to think about relative to iPhones
   pricing.
   PCs were made up of hardware, OS, chips. To have low prices Intel and
   Microsoft benefited from an ecosystem that "raced to the bottom".
6. Intel and Microsoft held on to most of the profits in selling PCs
   (and MS w/Office). The retailers and PC makers had very slim (to
   zero) margins for two decades. Often PC hardware seemed like a
   suckers bet.
7. The first key to having low priced offerings is that you have to have
   a set of partners who are willing to compete on thin margins in order
   to bring the product to market. 
   Very tough for one player to be the high margin and low margin
   players. Race yourself to the bottom?
8. The second key thing PCs benefitted from was a channel that allowed
   distribution by price maintaining price walls - business PCs could be
   expensive/sold direct (ThinkPad); consumer PCs sold as a bundles with
   high margin components useless as business PCs. (Dell's Inspiron and
   Optiplex etc.)
9. Buying a PC was a complex navigation through model line selected by
   segment (Big Business direct, SMB, individual, Education,
   Government). Then each form factor was "good, better, best".
   Byzantine. That's how you offer low prices and avoid everyone paying
   and have some margin.
10. Plus that is where crapware comes from --- those partners need some
    way to make margin. Adding software, selling screen real-estate, and
    so on are the only tools remain that allow for partners to make
    something when hardware and OS are fixed. 
11. This is how business always does premium+low priced offers, eg
    clothing where brands stand for luxury but aspire to mass market.
    Brands like Calvin Klein, Ralph Laruen, Armani w/ topi tier labels
    (like Purple) at select channels or direct. BUT also have mass
    market/discount.
12. Each of those distribution points is a different label, different
    quality, and so on. No retailer that carries Purple will carry Sport
    or RL. They might want to but they won't be allowed to ---
    distribution constraint that is carefully managed.
13. So when people say Apple needs a cheaper phone there are many
    questions to answer beyond the "get over yourself" luxury brand
    issue.
    What is distribution constraint? What partner absorbs some cost to
    leave margin? What is the branding? 
14. Easy question --- would a cheap phone be sold and supported in Apple
    stores side by side? How would the rest of the customers feel about
    more crowds and tougher appointments competing with people who paid
    half as much? Sell one phone against another --- how? 
15. This doesn't even have to be a product question which most people
    jump to --- sure remove fancy camera, memory, storage,e tc.
    But these are all hardware items that competitive products will
    simply add and market against --- "buy our android phone with
    portrait mode".
16. Apple is constrained by software because apps need to work on all
    devices --- something that Apple has stretched further than Windows
    ever did (watch to phone to tablet, and soon Mac). ISVs/devs will
    never embrae API differences at different price points. 
17. Consumers bemoan Windows 10 Home, Pro, Enterprise. Insane energy
    goes into trying to have features that don't fragment developers and
    OEMs (drivers, etc) and can be deployed efficiently while alos
    maintaining price differentiation. That's literally the entire
    Windows business. 
18. The levers available to do cheaper products are not all available to
    Apple. Those that simply say they have a pricing problem need to
    solve for the product, the distribution, the branding, and more.
19. Big companies become *enormously* consternated over brand value
    props, channel conflicts, and so on. Where Apple avoided all of
    these was owning them all. The downside of owning them all is this
    limits responding to the challenges.
20. At Microsoft we always reminded ourselves that you don't sell 300M
    of something at one every day low price. Most all energy was to
    maintain price floor. 
    *AMAZINGLY* Apple managed to sell over 200M of something per year at
    pretty much one every day high price, then increased price.
21. Anyone that thinks Apple is unaware of the challenge and has not
    sketched out ideas, tested them, and thought about them immensely is
    crazy. Literally this consumes a company or at least has been the
    past year. 
22. Example --- I can't count how many times Windows/Office toyed with
    "lite" versions. Fewer features cost less. DUH! Imaging such product
    and *everyone* wants it. How do you market it? What brand is it? How
    much revenue do you forgo? Is it freemium? trialware? annoying?
23. Literally the constant drumbeat from the press, partners, channel
    was that PCs were too expensive, Windows or Office too expensive. No
    matter what the price was. Also Intel hearing the same. Magic for
    Intel/MS was getting others to cave --- who caves for Apple?
24. I once  ran the numbers on selling just one SKU of Office rather
    than the seemingly infinite number. It was literally billions of
    dollars of lost revenue immediately and more over time --- leaving
    revenue on table PLUS alienating customers at both high end and low
    end. 
25. What does all these mean? Apple may or may not have a "pricing" or
    "price point" or "structural"/secular challenge. For sure just
    releasing a cheap phone doesn't make all better. 
    All takes place in context of lots of cheap/bad competitive phones. 
    Lots to consider.
